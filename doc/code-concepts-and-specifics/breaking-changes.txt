1) apparently css classes do not respect capital letters. Hence in the css, the change must be
theorion -> text_section
This is the app. css convention: xxxCapital goes to xxx_capital
In particular, all topic names converted this way.

For example, this is possibly a breaking change:
.menu-teaf.theorion .decorated.litem-${ix},
-                .menu-teaf.theorion .litem-${ix},
-                .menu-teaf.theorion .shuttle-${ix} {
-                    left       :${theorionChildWidth*ix}%;
+                .menu-teaf.textSection .decorated.litem-${ix},
+                .menu-teaf.textSection .litem-${ix},
+                .menu-teaf.textSection .shuttle-${ix} {


2) replacement theorion -> textSection
should be done line by line with understanding what each line does. There are 280 such lines. It cannot be done in batch mode. And this is a lot of work actually. And after this each lemma's theorion should have a regression test. (Like after each major change.)

(3) Very low importance, but trend is that changes in core scr/basic (like theorion) do break compatibility with other educational sofware, f.e. parxis.
