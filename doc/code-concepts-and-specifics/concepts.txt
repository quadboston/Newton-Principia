The application concept is dynamic css assuming this is good for educational software.

Whyle it is completely fine to have both static css (like, at the moment, basic/css ), the coder should know, there are <style> tags which change from aspect to aspect, or from corollary to corollary, or when Δt changes a value. And this cannot be done with static css variables.

For example, at the moment in file base/roots.css

:root {
    /* constants */
    --color-main : #202936;

variable color-main cannot be changed by user's action or when body's orbit enters near other body.

Some dynamic css constructs have <style> id in html <head>, like for example, glocss-id-force or glocss-id-sagitta (see picture).
