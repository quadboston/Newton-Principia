To pinpoint to visibility of the shape (say 'AC' )
in specific text fragment, for example, in lemma10
the fragment can be named:   "subessay" : "lemma10"
(any unique name can be used)

*::*proof|english
{
  "logic_phaseCaption" : "Proof",
   "subessay" : "lemma10"
}

and in sconf.js the ccsClass added

{ 'AC' : { pcolor : given,
           cssClass : "subessay--lemma10",
} },

I know, this make takes a burden to add desired classes in too many places.
In given example, only in two places.


To ease this burden, I can develop conjunction of conditions in core code, say
logic_phase : claim && sappId : lemma10
but this will take few hours of work.
