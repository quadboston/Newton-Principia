In lemma4, original curve polynomial representation changed from Taylor to divided differences.

...l4 needs really inscribed bars ... not the broken one ...
.... l4 in progress ... still needs proofcheck, cleanup ... and
zebra-colors, swap bars to make them "approaching a ratio" instead of having it
...l4 needs a legend "set forth" upon discussion

perhaps implementing non-similarity

        Jun 7, 15:02. Finished chemical table and snake.
        Going to spawn k. project into master package-application.

        Will build on top of
        /var/www/html/np/prj/7604-ver-table-as


        Previous job fragment had noise problems. Now will try to work
        clean on top of former noise.

        Noise was detected at phase = 
        /var/www/html/np/prj/7603-ver-noise-began.zip

        Good stable point before is
        /var/www/html/np/prj/7597-ver-TO7590-before-beaker.zip
        and 5 "as as" after that.
        Don't want to waste time on cleanup. Need to complete job.

8618 Princ. theorem 1 and 2 have module decor-conf.js which
    is additional config for points, lines, and polies.
    Coder must pay attention to svg-z-order where points
    svg is created in media modules, but some dec-lines and dec-polies
    are created right in decor-conf.js.

    svg-shapes visibility (during evolution of model-time) is controlled via 
    decStart, ...End, "undisplay" flags and via theor1proof, ... flags;

    in all "scenarios", the final paint happens/"filters" inside call to
    time-slider functions;

8775 - 8975 - ... stripping extra CSS bells and wistles from engine
    1. framwork of multiple stdMod ( study models ) works better,
       study models are isolated much clearer,
       rg (model registry), toreg, now can be per stdMod, not only per entire lemma,
       bg image is clearly per stdMod,
       workareas resize engine is is clearly per stdMod,

    2. apparent problem for previous versions:
        a. topic highlight machinery is not applied to topic-shapes in svg unless
           topic is introduced in professor-script by adding topick's keyName,
        b. global-css is repeated each time when next link-in-proff-script repeats the
           topic,
        todo: do fix this,
        c. topic-script is not enambled in User-console,
