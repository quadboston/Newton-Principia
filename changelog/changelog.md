# Change Log
 
 
## Upcoming
* Proposition 9: improved data section

 
## 2025-2-14 [0.13350]
### Improved
* Homepage
    * models accessible without scrolling (except on narrow screens)
    * accessibility metadata

* Lemmas 2 and 3:
    * non-monotonic curves allowed for improved interaction, with rectangles applied to largest monotonic region

* Lemma 7, proof tab
    * rectilinar angle reported
    * greater rectilinear angle range
    * fixed B being being able to pass rectilinear angle

* Proposition 6
    * graph vertical scale always 0 to 100% to better convey minimal force changes

* Proposition 7
    * more text syncs with model

* Models (general)
    * text-model partition placement persists across models and behaves when browser resized
    * where appropriate, tabs renamed "Problem [n]" and "Solution(s)"


## 2025-1-8 [0.13169]
 
### Improved
* Homepage
    * updated and expanded Usage Tips
    * added resource references, legal section, feedback link, and tip jar

* Lemmas 2 through 10:
    * point rendering consistent with later models

* Lemmas 2, 3
    * lowest curve handle constrained vertically so as to not create inscribed rectangle, as Newton implies
    * curve handles moved so as to not be confused with intersection points
 

## 2024-12-13 [0.13123]
 
### Improved
* Proposition 6
    * graph shows convergence of estimated and actual force
    * handle priority now Q > P > orbit
    * reported values moved from model and graph to separate data section
    * removed option for constant chord length because it complicated more than it helped
    * better graph labels
    * unused model components removed from proof and corollaries
    * fixed circle highlight

* Lemma 8
    * fixed inconsistent proof-then-video vs video-then-proof behavior
    * keeps RD parallel to original RD for more intuitive interpretation

### Added
* "What's New" link on home page
