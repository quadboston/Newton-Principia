Let a ¦body P¦body¦¦ revolve in a spiral ¦orbit¦PQS¦¦ intersecting all its radii ¦SP¦SP¦¦,
¦SQ¦¦, ... , at a
given angle; it is required to find the law of the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ tending toward
the ¦S¦center of the spiral¦¦.

Let the indefinitely small angle ¦SP SQ¦PSQ¦¦ be given, and because all the angles
are given, the species [i.e., the ratio of all the parts] of the figure ¦SP SQ QR QT¦SPRQT¦¦
will be given.

Therefore, the ratio ¦QT¦¦/¦QR¦¦ is given, and ¦QT¦¦²/¦QR¦¦ is as ¦QT¦¦, that is
(because the species of the figure is given), as ¦SP¦¦. Now change the angle ¦SP SQ¦PSQ¦¦
in any way, and the straight line ¦QR¦¦ subtending the angle of contact ¦QP PR¦QPR¦¦

will be changed (by lem. 11) as the square of ¦PR¦¦ or ¦QT¦¦. Therefore,
¦QT¦¦²/¦QR¦¦
will remain the same as before, that is, as ¦SP¦¦. And therefore ¦QT¦¦² x ¦SP¦¦² / ¦QR¦¦
is as ¦SP¦¦³, and thus

(by prop. 6, corols. 1 and 5)
</a>,

the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely
as the cube of the distance ¦SP¦¦. Q.E.I.
<br><br>

<i>Another solution</i>
<br><br>

The perpendicular ¦SY¦¦ dropped to the tangent, and the chord ¦PV¦¦ of the
¦curvatureCircle¦circle cutting the spiral concentrically¦¦,
are to the distance ¦SP¦¦ in given ratios;
and thus ¦SP¦¦³ is as ¦SY¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦,
that is

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop6,textSectionId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary3">
(by prop. 6, corols. 3 and 5)
</a>,

inversely as the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦.
