Lemma 8 makes a claim about 3 related triangles (which you can see 
¦RAB AR BR AB¦here¦¦, 
¦RACB AR BR arc-AB¦here¦¦, 
and ¦RAD AR RD AD¦here¦¦). 
These triangles are related to each other in that all 3 are bounded by these 
¦AR RD¦2 lines¦¦. Their 3rd side is either this 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, this 
¦AB¦chord¦¦, or this 
¦AD¦tangent¦¦ which touches the 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ at an ¦A¦endpoint¦¦ of the 
¦AB¦chord¦¦. Lemma 8 claims that when the ¦AB¦chord¦¦’s ¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ approach each other along the 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ and meet, that the area of these 
¦RAB RACB RAD AR RD AD AB arc-AB¦triangles¦¦ ultimately have ratios of equality. 

<br><br>
Notice the lemma does not require the 
¦RAB RACB RAD AR RD AD AB arc-AB¦triangles¦¦ to have any particular properties beyond how they are related to each other. For instance, the 
¦RAD AR RD AD¦large triangle¦¦ bounded by the tangent can be a right triangle as in Newton’s illustration, 
or it can be acute, 
or it can be obtuse. You can drag point R to have the model show any of these situations.

<br>
To prove lemma 8’s claim, we start by enlarging each item in the claim such that the enlarged item 
is similar to the original. All the enlarged items share a 
¦A¦vertex¦¦ with an 
¦A¦endpoint¦¦ of the 
¦AB¦original chord¦¦. Here’s the 
¦arc-Ab¦enlarged arc¦¦ which is similar to the 
¦arc-AB¦original arc¦¦. Here are the 
¦rAb rAcb rAd A,imageOfR A,imageOfD imageOfR,imageOfD Ab arc-Ab¦enlarged triangles¦¦ which are similar to the 
¦RAB RACB RAD AR RD AD AB arc-AB¦original triangles¦¦.

<br><br>
Now as the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ 
¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ approach each other along the 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, we leave the 
¦rAd A,imageOfR imageOfR,imageOfD A,imageOfD¦largest enlarged triangle¦¦ unchanged, 
and we keep all enlarged items similar to their diminishing counterpart. As the 
¦AB¦chord¦¦ 
¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ meet, 
¦Ab A,imageOfD¦this angle¦¦ must diminish to 0. When it does, these 
¦rAb rAcb rAd A,imageOfR A,imageOfD imageOfR,imageOfD Ab arc-Ab¦3 enlarged triangles¦¦ must coincide and be equal. Since the 
¦RAB RACB RAD AR RD AD AB arc-AB¦diminishing triangles¦¦ are always similar to their 
¦rAb rAcb rAd A,imageOfR A,imageOfD imageOfR,imageOfD Ab arc-Ab¦larger counterparts¦¦, they too must ultimately become similar and equal to each other.

<br>
As those ¦RAB RACB RAD AR RD AD AB arc-AB¦triangles¦¦ are ultimately equal, they can be used interchangeably when we discuss ultimate ratios.
