If the given straight lines ¦AR¦¦ and ¦BR¦¦, together with the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦,
its chord ¦AB¦¦,
and the tangent ¦AD¦¦, constitute three triangles
¦RAB AR AB BR¦RAB¦¦, ¦RACB AR BR arc-AB¦RACB¦¦, and ¦RAD AR RD AD¦RAD¦¦, and if
then points ¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ approach each other, I say that the ¦RAB RACB RAD AR AB BR arc-AB RD AD¦ triangles ¦¦ as they vanish
are similar in their ultimate form, and that their ¦RACB-RAB RAD-RAB¦ultimate ratio is one of equality¦¦.

For while point ¦B¦¦ approaches
point ¦A¦¦, let ¦AB¦¦, ¦AD¦¦, and ¦AR¦¦ be
understood always to be produced
to the distant points ¦b¦¦, ¦d¦d¦¦, and ¦r¦r¦¦, and
¦r,d¦rbd¦¦ to be drawn parallel to ¦RD¦¦;
and let arc ¦arc-Ab¦Acb¦¦ be always similar
to arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦. Then as points ¦A¦¦ and
¦B¦¦ come together, the angle ¦Ab A,d¦bAd¦¦ will

vanish, and therefore the three triangles ¦rAb Ab A,r r,b¦rAb¦¦,
¦rAcb A,r arc-Ab r,b¦rAcb¦¦,
and ¦rAd r,d A,r A,d¦rAd¦¦, which are always finite, will coincide and on that account are similar and ¦rAcb-rAb rAd-rAb¦equal¦¦. Hence
also ¦RAB AR AB BR¦RAB¦¦, ¦RACB AR BR arc-AB¦RACB¦¦,
and ¦RAD AR RD AD¦RAD¦¦, which will always be similar and proportional
to these, will ultimately become similar and ¦RACB-RAB RAD-RAB¦equal to one another¦¦. &nbsp; Q.E.D
