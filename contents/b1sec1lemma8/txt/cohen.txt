If the given straight lines ¦AR¦¦ and ¦BR¦¦, together with the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦,
its chord ¦AB¦¦,
and the tangent ¦AD¦¦, constitute three triangles
¦AR AB BR¦RAB¦¦, ¦AR BR arc-AB¦RACB¦¦, and ¦AR RD AD¦RAD¦¦, and if
then points ¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ approach each other, I say that the ¦AR AB BR arc-AB RD AD¦ triangles ¦¦ as they vanish
are similar in their ultimate form, and that their ultimate ratio is one of equality.

For while point ¦B¦¦ approaches
point ¦A¦¦, let ¦AB¦¦, ¦AD¦¦, and ¦AR¦¦ be
understood always to be produced
to the distant points ¦b¦¦, ¦imageOfD¦d¦¦, and ¦imageOfR¦r¦¦, and
¦imageOfR,imageOfD¦rbd¦¦ to be drawn parallel to ¦RD¦¦;
and let arc ¦arc-Ab¦Acb¦¦ be always similar
to arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦. Then as points ¦A¦¦ and
¦B¦¦ come together, the angle ¦Ab Ad¦bAd¦¦ will

vanish, and therefore the three triangles ¦Ab A,imageOfR imageOfR,b¦rAb¦¦,
¦A,imageOfR arc-Ab imageOfR,b¦rAcb¦¦,
and ¦imageOfR,imageOfD A,imageOfR A,imageOfD¦rAd¦¦, which are always finite, will coincide and on that account are similar and equal. Hence
also ¦AR AB BR¦RAB¦¦, ¦AR BR arc-AB¦RACB¦¦,
and ¦AR RD AD¦RAD¦¦, which will always be similar and proportional
to these, will ultimately become similar and equal to one another. &nbsp; Q.E.D

And hence ¦AR AB BR arc-AB RD AD¦those triangles¦¦ can be used for one another interchangeably in any argumentation concerning ultimate ratios.
