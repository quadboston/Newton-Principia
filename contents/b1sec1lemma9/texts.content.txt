Consider ¦ABD ACE¦two curvlinear triangles¦¦ bounded on one side by a ¦AE¦line¦¦, on another side by a ¦ABC¦curve¦¦, and on their last sides by ¦DB EC¦parallel lines¦¦. Note the ¦A¦point¦¦ joining the shared ¦AE¦line¦¦ and ¦ABC¦curve¦¦. As the ¦DB EC¦parallel lines¦¦ approach that ¦A¦point¦¦, in the limit, the ¦ABDPerACE¦ratio of the triangles’ areas¦¦ equals the ¦AD2PerAE2¦squared ratio¦¦ of their ¦AD AE¦sides¦¦.







*::*proof|english

For while points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ approach point ¦A¦¦,
let ¦AD¦AD¦¦ be understood always to be produced to the distant points ¦d¦¦ and ¦e¦¦,
so that ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ and ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦ are proportional to ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦;

and erect ordinates ¦db¦db¦¦ and ¦ec¦ec¦¦
parallel to ordinates ¦DB¦DB¦¦ and ¦EC¦EC¦¦
and meeting ¦AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦AC¦AC¦¦, produced, at ¦b¦¦ and ¦c¦¦.

Understand the curve ¦Abc¦Abc¦¦ to be drawn similar to ¦ABC¦ABC¦¦, and
the straight line ¦Ag¦Ag¦¦ to be drawn touching both curves at ¦A¦¦ and
cutting the ordinates ¦DB¦DB¦¦, ¦EC¦EC¦¦, ¦db¦db¦¦, and ¦ec¦ec¦¦ at F, G, ¦f¦¦, and ¦g¦¦.

Then, with the ¦Ae-length¦length¦¦ ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦ remaining the same,
let points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ come together with point ¦A¦¦; and as the angle cAg vanishes,

the curvilinear areas ¦Abd¦Abd¦¦ and ¦Ace¦Ace¦¦ will coincide with the
rectilinear areas ¦Afd Ad¦Afd¦¦ and ¦Age Ae¦Age¦¦,
and thus (by lem. 5) will be in the squared ratio of the sides ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ and ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦.

But areas ¦ABD¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦ACE¦¦ are always proportional to these areas,
and sides ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦ to these sides.

Therefore areas ¦ABD¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦ACE¦¦ also are ultimately 
in the ¦AD2PerAE2¦squared ratio¦¦ of the sides ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦.  Q.E.D.

Make an ¦Abd Ace¦enlargement¦¦ of the ¦ABD ACE¦two original triangles¦¦, and place them such that they still share the same ¦A¦point¦¦ and ¦Ae¦straight line¦¦ shared by the ¦ABD ACE¦original triangles¦¦.

As the ¦ABD ACE¦two original triangles¦¦ shrink, keep the ¦Ae-length¦length¦¦ of the ¦Ae¦shared line¦¦ for the ¦Ace¦largest triangle¦¦ the ¦Ae-length¦same length¦¦, and adjust the ¦Ab Ac db ec¦other sides¦¦ and ¦Abc¦curve¦¦ of the ¦Abd Ace¦enlarged triangles¦¦ as necessary so that they continue to be ¦Abd Ace¦enlarged versions¦¦ of the ¦ABD ACE¦shrinking triangles¦¦.

In the limit, as the ¦ABD ACE¦two original triangles¦¦ shrink, the ¦Abc¦curve¦¦ that bounds the ¦Abd Ace¦two enlarged curvilinear triangles¦¦ flattens to a ¦Ag¦straight line¦¦, meaning the ¦Abd Ace¦two enlarged curvilinear triangles¦¦ become ¦Afd Age¦two linear triangles¦¦. By Lemma 5, we know the ratio of the areas of these ¦Afd Age¦two linear triangles¦¦ will be equal to the squared ratio of their ¦Ad Ae¦matching sides¦¦.

We also know that ¦Ad Ae¦matching sides¦¦ of the ¦Abd Ace¦enlarged triangles¦¦ must have the same ratio to each other as ¦AD AE¦matching sides¦¦ of the ¦ABD ACE¦original triangles¦¦.

So in the limit, the ¦ABDPerACE¦ratio of the areas¦¦ of the ¦ABD ACE¦original triangles¦¦ converge to the same ¦AD2PerAE2¦ratio as the squares¦¦ of their ¦AD AE¦sides¦¦.
