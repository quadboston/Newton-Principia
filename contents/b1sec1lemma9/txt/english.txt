If the straight line ¦AE¦¦ and
the curve ¦ABC¦¦,
both given in position,
intersect each other at a given angle ¦AE ABC¦A¦¦, and
if ¦DB¦BD¦¦ and ¦EC¦CE¦¦ are drawn as ordinates to the straight line ¦AE¦AE¦¦ at another given angle
and meet the curve in ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦,
and if then points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ simultaneously approach point ¦A¦¦,
I say that the areas of the triangles ¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦¦
will ultimately
¦ABDPerACE¦be to each other¦¦
as the ¦AD2PerAE2¦squares of the sides¦¦.

For while points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ approach point ¦A¦¦,
let ¦AD¦AD¦¦ be understood always to be produced to the distant points ¦d¦¦ and ¦e¦¦,
so that ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ and ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦ are proportional to ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦;

and erect ordinates ¦db¦db¦¦ and ¦ec¦ec¦¦
parallel to ordinates ¦DB¦DB¦¦ and ¦EC¦EC¦¦
and meeting ¦AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦AC¦AC¦¦, produced, at ¦b¦¦ and ¦c¦¦.

Understand the curve ¦Abc¦Abc¦¦ to be drawn similar to ¦ABC¦ABC¦¦, and
the straight line ¦Ag¦Ag¦¦ to be drawn touching both curves at ¦A¦¦ and
cutting the ordinates ¦DB¦DB¦¦, ¦EC¦EC¦¦, ¦db¦db¦¦, and ¦ec¦ec¦¦ at F, G, ¦f¦¦, and ¦g¦¦.

Then, with the ¦Ae-length¦length¦¦ ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦ remaining the same,
let points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ come together with point ¦A¦¦; and as the angle cAg vanishes,

the curvilinear areas ¦Abd¦Abd¦¦ and ¦Ace¦Ace¦¦ will coincide with the
rectilinear areas ¦Afd Ad¦Afd¦¦ and ¦Age Ae¦Age¦¦,
and thus (by lem. 5) will be in the squared ratio of the sides ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ and ¦Ae¦Ae¦¦.

But areas ¦ABD¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦ACE¦¦ are always proportional to these areas,
and sides ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦ to these sides.

Therefore areas ¦ABD¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦ACE¦¦ also are ultimately 
in the ¦AD2PerAE2¦squared ratio¦¦ of the sides ¦AD¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦AE¦¦.  Q.E.D.
