    //\\ Meta parsing
    Meta parsing block can be inserted in any essay and has global effect on all lemma's essays.
    Meta parsing is a text preporcessor.
    Meta parsing spawns key-phrases by finding "caption-key" in texts.
    Batch key-phrases: |paint-keys|caption-key|||
    meta parsing goes before parsing,
    1) caption-key must have no reserved reg-ex-chars: [ ] { } ( ) \ ^ $ . | ? * +
    2) no shared dividors in ajacent key-phrases,
       f.e. in text "...ABFD XXX ..." won't work for controls
            |v2graph VSarea|ABFD| |some|XXX|| because space between ABFD and XXX will be used by ABFD,
            (do double space in this example,)
    3) caption-key is separated with spacers and with \n \r [ ] ( ) { } + . * - ,
       caption-key must be not caught inside of key-phrases already existing in text,
       Not like this: |MM ABFD MM|some ABFD some||. This will insert "ABFD" inside other key-phrase and
       corrupt parser.
       a) To disable caption-key inside other caption-key,
       neutral solid can be appended to it like for example in empty html comment: |..|... ABFD‹!--  --›...||
       b) To disable caption-key inside paint-keys,
       attach solid character "/" to caption-key to separate it |some/ABFD..|some||.
       (Separator between paint-keys can be any string of spacers and "/"s.)

<span style="font-size:10px;">a. For a gloss on this proposition see the Guide, §10.12.</span>
<br><br>

Let any force tend toward a center ¦C¦¦; and let it be required to find the
trajectory VIK𝑘. Let the circle ¦MainCircle¦VR¦¦ be given, described about the center C
with any radius CV; and about the same center let there be described any
other circles ID and KE cutting the trajectory in I and K and cutting the
straight line CV in D and ¦E¦¦.
<br><br>

Then draw the straight line ¦CX¦CNIX¦¦ cutting
the circles KE and VR in N and X, and also draw the straight line ¦CY¦CKY¦¦
meeting the circle VR in Y.
<br><br>

Let the points I and K be very close indeed
to each other, and let the body proceed from V through I and K to ¦k¦𝑘¦¦;

and let point ¦A¦¦ be the place from which another body must fall so as to acquire
at place D a ¦vgraph vback vgpoint¦velocity¦¦ equal to the velocity of the first body at I. And with
everything remaining as it was in prop. 39, the line-element IK, described in
a given minimally small time, will be as the velocity and hence as the straight
line whose square equals the area ABFD, and the triangle ICK proportional
to the time will be given; and therefore KN will be inversely as the height
IC, that is, if some quantity Q is given and the height IC is called A, as
¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦.
<br><br>


Let us denote this quantity ¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦ by Z, and let us suppose the magnitude
of Q to be such that in some one case √¦VSarea¦ABFD¦¦ is to Z as IK is to KN,
and in every case √¦v2graph VSarea¦ABFD¦¦ will be to Z as IK to KN and ABFD to Z² as
¦IK¦¦² to ¦NK¦KN¦¦², and by separation [or dividendo] ABFD — Z²
will be to Z²
as ¦IN¦¦² to ¦NK¦KN¦¦², and therefore √(ABFD - Z²) will be to Z,
or ¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦, as IN to
KN, and therefore A x KN will be equal to
(Q x IN) / √(ABFD - Z²).
<br><br>

Hence, since YX x XC is to A x KN as ¦CX¦¦² to ¦CD¦A¦¦²,
the rectangle XY x XC will be equal
(Q x IN x ¦CX¦¦²) / ( Q x IN x ¦CX¦¦² ) / (¦CD¦A¦¦² √(ABFD - Z²).

Therefore, in the perpendicular DF take D𝑏 and D𝑐
always equal respectively to ¦VM¦Q¦¦/(2√(ABFD - Z²)) and
(Q x ¦CX¦¦²) /(2¦CD¦A¦¦²√(ABFD - Z²)), and

describe the curved lines 𝑎𝑏 and 𝑎𝑐  which the points 𝑏 and 𝑐
continually trace
out, and from point V erect V𝑎 perpendicular to the line AC so as to cut
off the curvilinear areas VD𝑏𝑎 and VD𝑐𝑎, and also erect the ordinates E𝑧
and E𝑥.
<br><br>

Then, since the rectangle D𝑏 x IN or D𝑏𝑧E is equal to half of the
rectangle A x KN or is equal to the triangle ICK, and the rectangle D𝑐 x IN
or D𝑐𝑥E is equal to half of the rectangle YX x XC or is equal to the triangle
XCY — that is, since the nascent particles D𝑏𝑧E and ICK of the areas VD𝑏𝑎
and VIC are always equal, and the nascent particles D𝑐𝑥E and XCY of the
areas VD𝑐𝑎  and VCX are always equal — the generated area VD𝑏𝑎  will be
equal to the generated area VIC and hence will be proportional to the time,
and the generated area VD𝑐𝑎  will be equal to the generated sector VCX.
<br><br>

Therefore, given any time that has elapsed since the body set out from place
V, the area VD𝑏𝑎  proportional to it will be given and hence the body's
height CD or CI will be given, and the area VD𝑐𝑎  and, equal to that area,
the sector VCX along with its angle VCI. And given the angle VCI and the
height CI, the place I will be given, in which the body will be found at the
end of that time. Q<!--  -->.E.I<!--  -->.

Lemma 41 contains two very major hypotheses.
<br><br>
1) Experimental and mental spaces are coincided.<br>
2) Ratios can be added, divided, multiplied.
<br><br>

Newton thoroughly avoids introducing metaphysical hypotheses, but makes huge ones other place in math.
<br><br>

Indeed, about item 1):


¦XCY fi orbit¦Left part of the diagram¦¦

contains ¦orbit¦¦ which is in experimental space. Right part of the diagram is what modern physisist conseders
¦VSarea D𝑐𝑥E/force Tkernel Fkernel Tarea fiArea D𝑏𝑧E¦math arguments and graphs¦¦ - mental. Newton places them intevowen on the same diagram. Does he think that what we think really exist in experimental space?

Preservation laws:
<br>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">

For known U(ρ) and E, v(ρ) is known, and equations for ¦CI¦distance¦¦
ρ(t) and angle φ(ρ) are:
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
            ρ˙² = v² - (M / ρ)², &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from (E) <br>
            dφ/dρ = φ˙/ρ˙ = M /¦CI CD¦ρ¦¦²/ρ˙, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from (M<!--  -->) <br>

            <br>
            dt = - T dρ,   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) <br>
            dφ = - v<sub>⟂</sub> / ρ  T dρ,   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (m) <br>
            where<br>
            T = ( v² - v<sub>⟂</sub>² )<sup> -½</sup>
        </div>
    </div>
<br>

Newton considers the case that there exist a ¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦ that v(¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦)=0,
hence, E=U(¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦).
( For example, this can be gravitational force U(ρ) = -γ / ρ with E ‹ 0. )
In this case, we chose potential energy reference point as U(¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦) and, doing so makes E = 0.
Consequently,

    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
            v² = -U(ρ) = <sub> ρ </sub> ∫ <sup>¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦</sup> &nbsp;f(ρ)dρ 
        </div>
    </div>
<br>

In Principia, function ¦VSarea¦U¦¦(ρ) is represented clearly as
¦VSarea¦area-function of ρ¦¦, and v²+U = const.
And this holds for all motions with ¦VM¦v<sub>⟂o</sub>¦¦ that
¦VM¦v<sub>⟂o</sub>¦¦ ‹ ¦V,v¦v<sub>o</sub>¦¦, and is an implicitly stated energy conservation law.
Therefore, to represent U(ρ), we take the motion with v<sub>⟂</sub> = 0, which is simply a fall from
point ¦CA¦ρ<sub>*</sub>¦¦ and which is also chosen in Principia "for another body<!--  --> must fall."
<br><br>

Now when we see how v²(ρ) function can be calculated, we rewrite solutions (e) and (m) as:

    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
            t = <sub> ρ </sub>∫<sup> ρ<sub>o</sub> </sup> &nbsp; Tdρ,

            φ = <sub> ρ </sub>∫<sup> ρ<sub>o</sub> </sup> &nbsp; v<sub>⟂</sub> / ρ Tdρ.

Notes:
<br><br>

Newton's diagram is so good that, one can draw ¦v2graph Z2graph¦potential well¦¦ between turning points of ¦orbit¦¦.

The upper cover of this ¦v2graph Z2graph¦well¦¦ is "kineic energy ¦v2graph¦v²¦¦ and the bottom boundary is "rotation energy" ¦Z2graph¦v<sub>⟂</sub>²¦¦.
<br><br>

For some values of ¦V,v¦v<sub>o</sub>¦¦, this ¦v2graph Z2graph¦well¦¦ is has upper and lower boundary points ρ which are "turning" points of the ¦orbit¦¦.
<br><br>

Newton's diagram fits diligently diagram which we reproduced here
by estimating Newton's initial values and making numerical calculation of second degree differential equation by computer.

Hence the greatest and least heights of bodies (that is,
the apsides of their trajectories) can be found expeditiously. For the apsides
are those points in which the straight line IC drawn through the ¦C¦center¦¦ falls
perpendicularly upon the trajectory VIK, which happens when the straight
lines IK and NK are equal, and thus when the area ABFD is equal to Z².

The angle KIN, in which the trajectory anywhere cuts
the line IC, is also expeditiously found from the given height IC of the body,
namely, by taking its sine to the radius as KN to IK, that is, as Z to the
square root of the area ABFD.

************ Corollary 3 is not yet proofchecked:

If with center C
and principal vertex V any conic VRS
is described, and from any point R
of it the tangent RT is drawn so as


to meet the axis CV, indefinitely produced, at point T; and, joining CR,
there is drawn the straight line CP,
which is equal to the abscissa CT and
makes an angle VCP proportional to
the sector VCR; then, if a centripetal

<img src="contents/b1sec8prop41/img/c3.jpg" style="width:50%; float:right;">


force inversely proportional to the cube of the distance of places from the
center tends toward that center C, and the body leaves the place V with the
proper velocity along a line perpendicular to the straight line CV, the body
will move forward in the trajectory VPQ which point P continually traces
out; and therefore, if the conic VRS is a hyperbola, the body will descend
to the center. But if the conic is an ellipse, the body will ascend continually
and will go off to infinity.
And conversely, if the body leaves
the place V with any velocity and, depending on whether the body has begun either to descend obliquely to the
center or to ascend obliquely from it,
the figure VRS is either a hyperbola or
an ellipse, the trajectory can be found
by increasing or diminishing the angle
VCP in some given ratio. But also, if
the centripetal force is changed into a
centrifugal force, the body will ascend obliquely in the trajectory VPQ, which
is found by taking the angle VCP proportional to the elliptic sector VRC and
by taking the length CP equal to the length CT, as above. All this follows
from the foregoing (prop. 41), by means of the quadrature of a certain curve,
the finding of which, as being easy enough, I omit for the sake of brevity.
