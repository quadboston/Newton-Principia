<span style="font-size:10px;">a. For a gloss on this proposition see the Guide, §10.12.</span>
<br><br>

Let any force tend toward a center ¦C¦¦; and let it be required to find the
trajectory VIK𝑘. Let the circle ¦MainCircle¦VR¦¦ be given, described about the center C
with any radius CV; and about the same center let there be described any
other circles ID and KE cutting the trajectory in I and K and cutting the
straight line CV in D and ¦E¦¦.
<br><br>

Then draw the straight line ¦CX¦CNIX¦¦ cutting
the circles KE and VR in N and X, and also draw the straight line ¦CY¦CKY¦¦
meeting the circle VR in Y.
<br><br>

Let the points I and K be very close indeed
to each other, and let the body proceed from V through I and K to ¦k¦𝑘¦¦;

and let point ¦A¦¦ be the place from which another body must fall so as to acquire
at place D a ¦vgraph vback vgpoint¦velocity¦¦ equal to the velocity of the first body at I. And with
everything remaining as it was in prop. 39, the line-element IK, described in
a given minimally small time, will be as the velocity and hence as the straight
line whose square equals the area ABFD, and the triangle ICK proportional
to the time will be given; and therefore KN will be inversely as the height
IC, that is, if some quantity Q is given and the height IC is called A, as
¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦.
<br><br>


Let us denote this quantity ¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦ by Z, and let us suppose the magnitude
of Q to be such that in some one case √¦VSarea¦ABFD¦¦ is to Z as IK is to KN,
and in every case √¦v2graph VSarea¦ABFD¦¦ will be to Z as IK to KN and ABFD to Z² as
¦IK¦¦² to ¦NK¦KN¦¦², and by separation [or dividendo] ABFD — Z²
will be to Z²
as ¦IN¦¦² to ¦NK¦KN¦¦², and therefore √(ABFD - Z²) will be to Z,
or ¦VM¦Q¦¦/¦CD¦A¦¦, as IN to
KN, and therefore A x KN will be equal to
(Q x IN) / √(ABFD - Z²).
<br><br>

Hence, since YX x XC is to A x KN as ¦CX¦¦² to ¦CD¦A¦¦²,
the rectangle XY x XC will be equal
(Q x IN x ¦CX¦¦²) / ( Q x IN x ¦CX¦¦² ) / (¦CD¦A¦¦² √(ABFD - Z²).

Therefore, in the perpendicular DF take D𝑏 and D𝑐
always equal respectively to ¦VM¦Q¦¦/(2√(ABFD - Z²)) and
(Q x ¦CX¦¦²) /(2¦CD¦A¦¦²√(ABFD - Z²)), and

describe the curved lines 𝑎𝑏 and 𝑎𝑐  which the points 𝑏 and 𝑐
continually trace
out, and from point V erect V𝑎 perpendicular to the line AC so as to cut
off the curvilinear areas VD𝑏𝑎 and VD𝑐𝑎, and also erect the ordinates E𝑧
and E𝑥.
<br><br>

Then, since the rectangle D𝑏 x IN or D𝑏𝑧E is equal to half of the
rectangle A x KN or is equal to the triangle ICK, and the rectangle D𝑐 x IN
or D𝑐𝑥E is equal to half of the rectangle YX x XC or is equal to the triangle
XCY — that is, since the nascent particles D𝑏𝑧E and ICK of the areas VD𝑏𝑎
and VIC are always equal, and the nascent particles D𝑐𝑥E and XCY of the
areas VD𝑐𝑎  and VCX are always equal — the generated area VD𝑏𝑎  will be
equal to the generated area VIC and hence will be proportional to the time,
and the generated area VD𝑐𝑎  will be equal to the generated sector VCX.
<br><br>

Therefore, given any time that has elapsed since the body set out from place
V, the area VD𝑏𝑎  proportional to it will be given and hence the body's
height CD or CI will be given, and the area VD𝑐𝑎  and, equal to that area,
the sector VCX along with its angle VCI. And given the angle VCI and the
height CI, the place I will be given, in which the body will be found at the
end of that time. Q<!--  -->.E.I<!--  -->.

Hence the greatest and least heights of bodies (that is,
the apsides of their trajectories) can be found expeditiously. For the apsides
are those points in which the straight line IC drawn through the ¦C¦center¦¦ falls
perpendicularly upon the trajectory VIK, which happens when the straight
lines IK and NK are equal, and thus when the area ABFD is equal to Z².

The angle KIN, in which the trajectory anywhere cuts
the line IC, is also expeditiously found from the given height IC of the body,
namely, by taking its sine to the radius as KN to IK, that is, as Z to the
square root of the area ABFD.

************ Corollary 3 is not yet proofchecked:

If with center C
and principal vertex V any conic VRS
is described, and from any point R
of it the tangent RT is drawn so as


to meet the axis CV, indefinitely produced, at point T; and, joining CR,
there is drawn the straight line CP,
which is equal to the abscissa CT and
makes an angle VCP proportional to
the sector VCR; then, if a centripetal

<img src="contents/b1sec8prop41/img/c3.jpg" style="width:50%; float:right;">


force inversely proportional to the cube of the distance of places from the
center tends toward that center C, and the body leaves the place V with the
proper velocity along a line perpendicular to the straight line CV, the body
will move forward in the trajectory VPQ which point P continually traces
out; and therefore, if the conic VRS is a hyperbola, the body will descend
to the center. But if the conic is an ellipse, the body will ascend continually
and will go off to infinity.
And conversely, if the body leaves
the place V with any velocity and, depending on whether the body has begun either to descend obliquely to the
center or to ascend obliquely from it,
the figure VRS is either a hyperbola or
an ellipse, the trajectory can be found
by increasing or diminishing the angle
VCP in some given ratio. But also, if
the centripetal force is changed into a
centrifugal force, the body will ascend obliquely in the trajectory VPQ, which
is found by taking the angle VCP proportional to the elliptic sector VRC and
by taking the length CP equal to the length CT, as above. All this follows
from the foregoing (prop. 41), by means of the quadrature of a certain curve,
the finding of which, as being easy enough, I omit for the sake of brevity.
