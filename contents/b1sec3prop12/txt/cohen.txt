Let a ¦P¦body¦¦ move in a ¦orbit¦hyperbola¦¦; it is required to find the law of the

Let ¦CA¦¦ and ¦CB¦¦ be the semiaxes of the ¦orbit¦hyperbola¦¦, ¦GP¦PG¦¦ and ¦DK¦KD¦¦ other
conjugate diameters, ¦PF¦¦ a perpendicular to the diameter KD, and ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ an
ordinate to the diameter ¦GP¦¦. Draw ¦SP¦¦ cutting diameter DK in ¦E¦¦ and ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ in 𝑥, and complete the parallelogram ¦QR PR Px Qx¦QRP𝑥¦¦. It is evident that ¦EP¦¦ is

equal to the transverse semiaxis ¦CA¦AC¦¦, because when line ¦HI¦¦ is drawn parallel
to ¦EC¦¦ 
from the other ¦H¦focus H¦¦ of the hyperbola, ¦ES¦¦ and ¦EI¦¦ are equal because
¦CS¦¦ and ¦CH¦¦ are equal;

so that ¦EP¦¦ is the half-difference of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PI¦¦, that
is (because ¦HI¦IH¦¦ and ¦PR¦¦ are parallel and the angles ¦PR PI¦IPR¦¦ and ¦PH P,Zminus¦HPZ¦¦ are equal),
of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PH¦¦, the difference of which equals the whole axis 2¦CA¦AC¦¦. Drop
¦QT¦¦ perpendicular to ¦SP¦¦. Then, if L denotes the principal latus rectum of
the hyperbola ( or 2BC² / ¦CA¦AC¦¦ ), L x ¦QR¦¦ will be to L x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ as ¦QR¦¦ to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, or ¦Px¦P𝑥¦¦

to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, that is (because the triangles ¦Px Pv xv¦P𝑥𝑣¦¦ and ¦EP EC PC¦PEC¦¦ are similar), as ¦PE¦¦ to ¦PC¦¦,
or ¦CA¦AC¦¦ to ¦PC¦¦. L x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ will also be to ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ as L to ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦; and (from the

nature of conics) the rectangle ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦Pv¦𝑣P¦¦ will be to ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² as ¦PC¦¦² to ¦CD¦¦²; and
(
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma7,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english">
by lem. 7, corol. 2</a>
)
the ratio of ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² to ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦², the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ coming
together, comes to be the ratio of equality; and ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦² or ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦AT¦¦² as ¦EP¦¦²

to ¦PF¦¦², that is, as ¦CA¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦², or (by lem. 12) as ¦CD¦¦² to ¦CB¦¦²; and if all these
ratios are combined, L x ¦QR¦¦ will be to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦CA¦AC¦¦ x L x ¦PC¦¦² x ¦CD¦¦² or
2¦CB¦¦² x ¦PC¦¦² x ¦CD¦¦² to ¦PC¦¦ x ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦CD¦¦² x ¦CB¦¦², or as 2¦PC¦¦ to ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦. But, the points

¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ coming together, 2¦PC¦¦ and ¦Gv¦G𝑣¦¦ are equal. Therefore, L x ¦QR¦¦ and
¦QT¦¦², which are proportional to these, are also equal. Multiply these equals by
¦SP¦¦²/¦QR¦¦, and L x ¦SP¦¦² will become equal to ¦SP¦¦² x ¦QT¦¦² / ¦QR¦¦. Therefore (by prop. 6,

corols. 1 and 5), the centripetal force is inversely as L x ¦SP¦¦², that is, inversely
as the square of the distance ¦SP¦¦. Q.E.I.

Find the force that tends from the center ¦C¦¦ of ¦orbit¦the hyperbola¦¦. This will
come out proportional to the distance ¦PC¦CP¦¦. And hence
(
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1prop7,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary3">
by prop. 7, corol. 3</a>
)
the force tending toward the focus ¦S¦¦ will be as ¦PE¦¦³/¦SP¦¦², that is, because ¦PE¦¦ is

given, inversely as ¦SP¦¦² . Q.E.I.

It is shown in the same way that if this centripetal force is turned into a
centrifugal force, a body will move in the opposite branch of the hyperbola.
