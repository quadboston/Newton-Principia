        <dense class='orig';>The same ultimate ratios are also ratios of equality when the widths ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦,...
        of the parallelograms are unequal and are all diminished indefinitely.</dense>

            <dense class='orig';>For let ¦AF¦¦ be equal to the greatest width,
            and let the ¦widest-rectangular widt-txt¦parallelogram FA𝑎𝑓¦¦ be completed. 
            This parallelogram will be greater than the ¦difference¦¦ of 
            the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ figures; 
            but if its width ¦AF¦¦ is diminished indefinitely,
            it will become less than any given rectangle. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.</dense>

Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 1. Hence the ultimate sum of
the vanishing parallelograms coincides with the curvilinear ¦figure Aa¦A𝑎𝑐E¦¦ in its every
part.
<br><br>

Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 2. And, all the more, the rectilinear figure that is comprehended 
by the chords of the vanishing arcs 𝑎𝑏, 𝑏𝑐, 𝑐𝑑, ... coincides ultimately with the curvilinear ¦figure Aa¦A𝑎𝑐E¦¦.
<br><br>

Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 3. And it is the same for the circumscribed rectilinear figure
that is comprehended by the tangents of those same arcs.
<br><br>

Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 4. And therefore these ultimate figures (with respect to their
perimeters ¦curve¦𝑎𝑐E¦¦) are not rectilinear, but curvilinear limits of rectilinear figures.
