Even if the rectangle ¦base¦bases¦¦ are unequal, 
the areas of the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ 
and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ rectangles 
will <i>still</i> converge on the area of the ¦figure-area¦figure¦¦ as we 
increase the number of ¦base¦bases¦¦.

Once the rectangle ¦base¦bases¦¦ are unequal, 
we can no longer count on the largest circumscribed rectangle 
to be equal in area to the ¦difference¦¦ between the 
¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ and ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ rectangle areas; 
it could be smaller. 
However, Newton constructs a ¦widest-rectangular widt-txt¦new rectangle¦¦ for this proof; 
one with a base as wide as the widest of the other bases.
<br><br>

As such,
it's guaranteed to be no smaller than the difference between the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ 
and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ rectangles. 
And as before with lemma 2, 
its area becomes as close to 0 as we like 
when we increase the number of ¦base¦bases¦¦. 
So as with lemma 2, 
the areas of the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ rectangles 
converge on the area of the ¦figure-area¦figure¦¦ as we increase the number of ¦base¦bases¦¦, 
even though we are not requiring the ¦base¦bases¦¦ to be of equal width.
