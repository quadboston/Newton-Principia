For suppose the time to be divided into equal parts, and in the first part
of that time let the body by its innate force describe the right line AB
In the second part of that time, the same would (by Law I.), if not hindered,
procee[d] directly to c, alo[ng] the line Be equal to AB ; so that by the radii AS, BS, cS,

draw[n] to the centre, the equal areas ASB, BSc, would be described.

<br><br>

But when the body
is arrived at B, suppose
that a centripetal force acts at once with a great im
pulse, and, turning aside the
body from the right line Be,
compels it afterwards to con
tinue its motion along the
right line BC. Draw cC
parallel to BS meeting BC
in C ; and at the end of the
second part of the time, the
body (by Cor. I. of the Laws)
will be found in C, in the same plane with the triangle
A SB. Join SC, and, because s SB and Cc are parallel, the triangle SBC will be equal to the triangle SBc,
and therefore also to the triangle SAB.
<br><br>

By the like argument, if the
centripetal force acts successively in C, D, E. &amp;c., and makes the body, in
each single particle of time, to describe the right lines CD, DE, EF7 &amp;c.,
they will all lie in the same plane : and the triangle SCD will be equal to the triangle SBC, and SDE to SCD, and SEF to SDE.
<br><br>

And therefore, in equal times, equal areas are described in one immovable plane : and, by
composition, any sums SADS, SAFS, of those areas, are one to the other
as the times in which they are described. Now let the number of those
triangles be augmented, and their breadth diminished in infinitum; and

(by Cor. 4, Lem. III.) their ultimate perimeter ADF will be a curve line : and therefore the centripetal force, by which the body is perpetually drawn
back from the tangent of this curve, will act continually ; and any described areas SADS, SAFS, which are always proportional to the times of description, will,

in this case also, be proportional to those times. Q.E.D.
<br><br><br>




COR. 1. The velocity of a body attracted towards an immovable centre,
in spaces void of resistance, is reciprocally as the perpendicular let fall from that centre on the right line that touches the orbit. For the veloci
ties in those places A, B, C, D, E. are as the bases AB, BC, CD, DE, EF.
of equal triangles ; and these bases are reciprocally as the perpendiculars
let fall upon them.
<br><br><br>

COR. 2. If the chords AB, BC of two arcs, successively described in equal times by the same body, in spaces void of resistance, are completed
into a parallelogram ABCV, and the diagonal BV of this parallelogram;
in the position which it ultimately acquires when those arcs are diminished
in irifinitum, is produced both ways, it will pass through the centre of force.
<br><br><br>


COR. 3. If the chords AB, BC, and DE, EF, cf arcs described in equal
times, in spaces void of resistance, are completed into the parallelograms
ABCV, DEFZ : the forces in B and E are one to the other in the ulti mate ratio of the diagonals BV, EZ, when those arcs are diminished in
infinitum. For the motions BC and EF of the body (by Cor. 1 of the
Laws) are compounded of the motions Be, BV, and E/&amp;quot;, EZ : but BV and
EZ, which are equal to Cc and F/, in the demonstration of this Proposi
tion, were generated by the impulses of the centripetal force in B and E; and are therefore proportional to those impulses.
<br><br><br>


COR. 4. The forces by which bodies, in spaces void of resistance, are drawn back from rectilinear motions, and turned into curvilinear orbits, are one to another as the versed sines of arcs described in equal times ; which
versed sines tend to the centre of force, and bisect the chords when those
arcs are diminished to infinity. For such versed sines are the halves of
the diagonals mentioned in Cor. 3.
<br><br><br>


COR. 5. And therefore those forces are to the force of gravity as the said
versed sines to the versed sines perpendicular to the horizon of those para
bolic arcs which projectiles describe in the same time.
<br><br><br>


COR. 6. And the same things do all hold good (by Cor. 5 of the Laws),
when the planes in which the bodies are moved, together with the centres of force which are placed in those planes, are not at rest, but move uni
formly forward in right lines. PROPOSITION II. THEOREM II.

<b>Numerical Model</b><br><br>

Dragging the slider under the picture changes the
¦time¦time¦¦.
<br><br>

The slider follows the proof. The ¦path¦particle path¦¦ thought experiment starts at point B. Time step Δt is chosen as a unit, so in context of Δt, movements and speeds are numerically equal.<br><br>

        Before step 1, body ¦path¦moves¦¦ from point A to point B and circumscribes a 
           ¦kepler-triangle¦"kepler-triangle-area"¦¦, <br><br>

        step 1. if speed would not change, then 
           body would move ¦free-path¦freely¦¦ from point B to point c,
           the area of ¦free-triangle¦"free-movement-triangle-area"¦¦ is equal
           to area of former ¦kepler-triangle¦"kepler-triangle"¦¦,<br><br>

        step 2. the force adds an impulse ¦force cssbold¦p¦¦ =
                <b>f</b>\(\Delta t\) to the speed,<br>
           ¦speed-change cssbold¦v¦¦¦\(v_{BC}\)\( = \)
                ¦speed-change cssbold¦v¦¦¦\(v_{Bc}\) +

                (*)
            <br><br>


        step 3. because of speed change, ¦path¦final position¦¦ changes from point c to point C,<br>
            \( \Delta \)¦path-change cssbold¦s¦¦¦\(s\)\( = \) 
            ¦path-change cssbold¦s¦¦¦\(s_{BC}\)\( = \)
                ¦path-change cssbold¦s¦¦¦\(s_{Bc}\) +
                ¦force cssbold¦p¦¦¦\(p\) \( \Delta \) t
            or<br>

            \( \Delta \)¦path-change cssbold¦s¦¦¦\(s\)\( = \)

            <br><br>

            ¦free-triangle¦"free-movement-triangle-area"¦¦
            is equal to new ¦kepler-triangle¦"kepler-triangle-area"¦¦,
            <br><br>

        step 4. previous and new ¦kepler-triangle¦"kepler-triangle-area"¦¦ are equal.<br><br>


        Next move, CD, is built in steps analogious to steps 1, 2, 3, 4.<br><br><br>



    We estimated the default parameters which fit Newton's original drawing for
page landing. They are:

        ¦force¦f¦¦¦
        ¦force¦force :¦¦¦
        ¦time¦time step :¦¦¦
        ¦time¦t¦¦¦

        \[ \\
        \text{force :}          \; f = 3.9 / r^2 , \\
        \text{time step :}      \; \Delta t = 1 ,\\
        \text{initial speed :}  \; v_{0} = 1.
        \]
(We were not able yet to estimate Newton's computer brand.)

Dragging point B can change the initial path and make it smaller which automatically extends model to increased number of moves.
