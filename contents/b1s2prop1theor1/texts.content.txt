<b>Numerical Simulation</b><br><br>

Dragging the slider under the picture changes the
¦time¦time¦¦.

The slider follows the proof. The particle imaginary analysis starts from point B.<br><br>

At beginning of each step, the particle ¦free-path¦moves free¦¦ like from point B to c.

At each step, applied ¦force¦force¦¦ changes direction of movement and ¦path¦final position and final path¦¦.

<br><br>
At each step, three triangles are compared to illustrate Kepler's law: the two ¦kepler-triangle¦triangles¦¦ circumscribed by the summary movment: triangle at previous step and final triangle of the current step

and 

¦free-triangle¦triangle¦¦ circumscribed by free movement.<br><br>


At page landing, the default parameters are chosen to fit Newton's drawing. They are:<br><br>

    Force,          f = 3.9 / (r*r)<br>
    Time step,      delta_t = 1<br>
    Initial speed,  v0 = 1<br>

<br>
Change them, by dragging point B. This will change initial direction of speed and the path length, delta_s, at initial step.<br><br>

The initial speed will stay always equal to 1. The time step will change as delta_t = delta_s / v0.

<br><br>
Formula for force is not changeable in this version.
