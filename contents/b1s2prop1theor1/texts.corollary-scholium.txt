<span class="captured-reference id-initial-state">T.1. Corollary 1.</span>

The velocity of a body attracted to an ¦S¦immobile centre¦¦ in
nonresisting spaces is inversely as the ¦SP¦perpendicular¦¦ dropped from that center to
the ¦TP¦rectilinear tangent¦¦ of the orbit. For in those places ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦C¦¦,
¦D¦¦, ¦E¦¦, the
velocity is as the bases of the equal triangles ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦, and
these bases are inversely as the perpendiculars dropped to them.
<br><br><br>




<span class="captured-reference id-corollary-2">T.1. Corollary 2.</span>

If the chords, ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦ of two arcs described successively in equal
times by the same body
in nonresisting spaces be completed into a parallelogram ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦,
and its ¦BV¦diagonal¦¦, in that
position which it ultimately has when those arcs are diminished in infinitum,
be produced in both directions, it will ¦SB¦pass through¦¦ the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦.
<br><br><br>



<span class="captured-reference id-initial-state">T.1. Corollary 3.</span>

If the chords ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦, and ¦DE¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦EF¦¦,
of arcs described in equal times, in
nonresisting spaces be completed into parallelograms ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦, ¦DEFZ¦DEFZ¦¦, the
forces at B and E are to each other in the ultimate ratio of the
diagonals ¦BV¦¦, ¦EZ¦¦,
where these arcs are diminished in infinitum.
<br><br>

For the motions ¦BC¦BC¦¦ and ¦EF¦EF¦¦ of the body are (by Corollary 1 of the Laws)
composed of the motions
¦Bh¦Bc¦¦, ¦BV¦BV¦¦, and ¦Eg¦Ef¦¦, ¦EZ¦EZ¦¦, equal to ¦Ch¦Cc¦¦ and ¦Fg¦Ff¦¦, were in the
demonstration of this proposition generated
by the ¦BV EZ¦impulses¦¦ of the centripetal force at B and E, and therefore are proportional to 
these ¦BV EZ¦impulses¦¦.
<br><br><br>


<span class="captured-reference id-corollary-4">T.1. Corollary 4.</span>
The ¦BV EZ¦forces¦¦ by which any bodies in nonresisting spaces are drawn back from rectilinear motions and are deflected into curved orbits are to one another as those
¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ of arcs described
in equal times which converge to the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦ and bisect ¦AC DF¦the chords¦¦, when
those arcs are diminished in infinitum. For these ¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ are
the halves of the ¦BV EZ¦diagonals¦¦ with which we have been concerned in Corollary 3.

T.1. Corollary 5.
Therefore, the same forces are to the force of gravity [gravitas] as these sagittae are to
the sagittae, perpendicular to the horizon, of parabolic arcs which projectiles describe in the
same time.

T.1. Corollary 6.
All the same things pertain, by Corollary 5 of the Laws, where the planes in which the
bodies move, along with the centres of forces located in them, are not at rest, but move
uniformely in a straight line.
