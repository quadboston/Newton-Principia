it is required to find the law of the centripetal
¦force¦¦ tending toward a focus of the ellipse.

Let ¦S¦¦ be a focus of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦. Draw ¦SP¦¦ cutting both the diameter ¦DK¦¦
of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦ in ¦E¦¦ and the ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ in ¦x¦𝑥¦¦, and complete the parallelogram
¦Qx PR¦Q𝑥PR¦¦. It is evident that ¦EP¦¦ is equal to the semiaxis major ¦AO¦AC¦¦ because when
line ¦HI¦¦ is drawn parallel to ¦EO¦EC¦¦ from the other focus ¦H¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦, ¦ES¦¦
and ¦EI¦¦ are equal because ¦OS¦CS¦¦ and ¦OH¦CH¦¦ are equal; so that ¦EP¦¦ is the half-sum
of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PI¦¦, that is (because ¦HI¦¦ and ¦PR¦¦ are parallel and angles ¦PI PR¦IPR¦¦ and
¦PH P,Zminus¦HPZ¦¦ are equal), the half-sum of ¦PS¦¦ and ¦PH¦¦ (which taken together equal
the whole axis 2¦AO¦AC¦¦). Drop ¦QT¦¦ perpendicular to ¦SP¦¦, and if L denotes the

principal latus rectum of the ellipse ( or 2¦BO¦BC¦¦² / ¦AO¦AC¦¦ ), L x ¦QR¦¦ will
be to L x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦

as ¦QR¦¦ to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, that is, as ¦EP¦PE¦¦ or ¦AO¦AC¦¦ to ¦PO¦PC¦¦; and
L x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ will be to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦Pv¦𝑣P¦¦ as

a. For a gloss on this proposition see <i>Source</i>, the Guide, §10.9.
<br><br>

L to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦; and<sup>b</sup>
 ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦Pv¦vP¦¦ will be to ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦²
 as PC² to CD²; and
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma7,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english">by lem. 7, corol. 2</a>)

the ratio of ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² to ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦²,
with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ coming together, is the
ratio of equality; and ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦² or ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦EP¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦²,
that is, as ¦AO¦CA¦¦² to
¦PF¦¦² or (by lem. 12) as ¦DO¦CD¦¦² to ¦BO¦CB¦¦².
And when all these ratios are combined, L x ¦QR¦¦ will be to ¦QT¦¦²
 as ¦AO¦AC¦¦ x L x ¦PO¦PC¦¦²
 x ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
, or as 2¦BO¦CB¦¦²
 x ¦PO¦PC¦¦²
 x ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
to ¦PO¦PC¦¦ x ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ x ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
 x ¦BO¦CB¦¦²
, or as 2¦PO¦PC¦¦ to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦. But with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦
coming together, 2¦PO¦PC¦¦ and ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ are equal. Therefore, L x ¦QR¦¦ and ¦QT¦¦²
, which
¦SP¦¦²
are proportional to these, are also equal. Multiply these equals by , and
¦SP¦¦²
 x ¦QT¦¦²
L x ¦SP¦¦²
 will become equal to . Therefore

 the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely as L x ¦SP¦¦²
, that is, inversely as the
square of the distance ¦SP¦¦. Q.E.I.

The ¦force¦¦ which tends toward ¦O¦the center¦¦ of ¦orbit¦the ellipse¦¦, and by which
¦P¦body P¦¦ can revolve in ¦orbit¦that ellipse¦¦, is

(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1prop10,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english">(by prop. 10, corol. 1)</a>)

as the distance ¦PO¦CP¦¦
of the body from the ¦O¦center C¦¦ of the ellipse; hence, if ¦EO¦CE¦¦ is drawn parallel to
the tangent ¦PR¦¦ of the ellipse and if ¦EO¦CE¦¦ and ¦SP¦PS¦¦ meet at ¦E¦¦, then the force by
which the same ¦P¦body P¦¦ can revolve around any other ¦S¦point S¦¦ of the ellipse
will
 
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1prop7,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary3">
(by prop. 7, corol. 3)</a>)


be as ¦EP¦PE¦¦³/¦SP¦¦²; that is, if point ¦S¦¦² is a focus of the ellipse,

and therefore ¦EP¦PE¦¦ is given, this force will be inversely as ¦SP¦¦²
. Q.E.I.
<br><br>

This solution could be extended to the parabola and the hyperbola as
concisely as in prop. 10, but because of the importance of this problem and
its use in what follows, it will not be too troublesome to confirm each of
these other cases by a separate demonstration.
