Let a ¦body P¦body¦¦ revolve in an ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦;
it is required to find the law of the centripetal
¦force¦¦ tending toward a ¦S¦focus¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦.

Let ¦S¦¦ be a focus of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦. Draw ¦SP¦¦ cutting both the diameter ¦DK¦¦
of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦ in ¦E¦¦ and the ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ in ¦x¦𝑥¦¦, and complete the parallelogram
¦Qx PR¦Q𝑥PR¦¦. It is evident that ¦EP¦¦ is equal to the semiaxis major ¦AC¦¦ because when
line ¦HI¦¦ is drawn parallel to ¦EC¦¦ from the other focus ¦H¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦, ¦ES¦¦
and ¦EI¦¦ are equal because ¦CS¦¦ and ¦CH¦¦ are equal; so that ¦EP¦¦ is the half-sum
of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PI¦¦, that is (because ¦HI¦¦ and ¦PR¦¦ are parallel and angles ¦PI PR¦IPR¦¦ and
¦PH P,Zminus¦HPZ¦¦ are equal), the half-sum of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PH¦¦ (which taken together equal
the whole axis 2¦AC¦¦). Drop ¦QT¦¦ perpendicular to ¦SP¦¦, and if L denotes the
principal latus rectum of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦

L × ¦QR¦¦ will
be to L × ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦
as ¦QR¦¦ to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, that is, as ¦EP¦PE¦¦ or ¦AC¦¦ to ¦PC¦¦; and
L × ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ will be to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦Pv¦𝑣P¦¦ as
L to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦; and
 ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦Pv¦𝑣P¦¦ will be to ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦²
 as ¦PC¦¦² to ¦DC¦CD¦¦²; and
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma7,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english">by lem. 7, corol. 2</a>)
the ratio of ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² to ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦²,
with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ coming together, is the
ratio of equality; and ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦² or ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦EP¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦²,
that is, as ¦AC¦CA¦¦² to
¦PF¦¦² or (by lem. 12) as ¦DC¦CD¦¦² to ¦BC¦CB¦¦².
And when all these ratios are combined, L × ¦QR¦¦ will be to ¦QT¦¦²
 as ¦AC¦¦ × L × ¦PC¦¦²
 × ¦DC¦CD¦¦²
, or as 2¦BC¦CB¦¦²
 × ¦PC¦¦²
 × ¦DC¦CD¦¦²
to ¦PC¦¦ × ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦DC¦CD¦¦²
 × ¦BC¦CB¦¦²
, or as 2¦PC¦¦ to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦. But with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦
coming together, 2¦PC¦¦ and ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ are equal. Therefore, L × ¦QR¦¦ and ¦QT¦¦², which
are proportional to these, are also equal. Multiply these equals by 

<!-- SP² / QR -->

 the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely as L × ¦SP¦¦², that is, inversely as the

This solution could be extended to the parabola and the hyperbola as
concisely as in <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop10">prop. 10</a>, but because of the importance of this problem and
its use in what follows, it will not be too troublesome to confirm each of
these other cases by a separate demonstration.
