Let a ¦body P¦body¦¦ revolve in an ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦;
it is required to find the law of the centripetal
¦force¦¦ tending toward a focus of the ellipse.

Let ¦S¦¦ be a focus of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦. Draw ¦SP¦¦ cutting both the diameter ¦DK¦¦
of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦ in ¦E¦¦ and the ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ in ¦x¦𝑥¦¦, and complete the parallelogram
¦Qx PR¦Q𝑥PR¦¦. It is evident that ¦EP¦¦ is equal to the semiaxis major ¦AO¦AC¦¦ because when
line ¦HI¦¦ is drawn parallel to ¦EO¦EC¦¦ from the other focus ¦H¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦, ¦ES¦¦
and ¦EI¦¦ are equal because ¦OS¦CS¦¦ and ¦OH¦CH¦¦ are equal; so that ¦EP¦¦ is the half-sum
of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PI¦¦, that is (because ¦HI¦¦ and ¦PR¦¦ are parallel and angles ¦PI PR¦IPR¦¦ and
¦PH P,Zminus¦HPZ¦¦ are equal), the half-sum of ¦SP¦PS¦¦ and ¦PH¦¦ (which taken together equal
the whole axis 2¦AO¦AC¦¦). Drop ¦QT¦¦ perpendicular to ¦SP¦¦, and if L denotes the
principal latus rectum of the ellipse (or 2¦BO¦BC¦¦²&nbsp;/&nbsp;¦AO¦AC¦¦), L × ¦QR¦¦ will
be to L × ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦
as ¦QR¦¦ to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, that is, as ¦EP¦PE¦¦ or ¦AO¦AC¦¦ to ¦PO¦PC¦¦; and
L × ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ will be to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦Pv¦𝑣P¦¦ as
L to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦; and
 ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦Pv¦vP¦¦ will be to ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦²
 as ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to ¦DO¦CD¦¦²; and
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma7,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english">by lem. 7, corol. 2</a>)
the ratio of ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² to ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦²,
with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ coming together, is the
ratio of equality; and ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦² or ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦EP¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦²,
that is, as ¦AO¦CA¦¦² to
¦PF¦¦² or (by lem. 12) as ¦DO¦CD¦¦² to ¦BO¦CB¦¦².
And when all these ratios are combined, L × ¦QR¦¦ will be to ¦QT¦¦²
 as ¦AO¦AC¦¦ × L × ¦PO¦PC¦¦²
 × ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
, or as 2¦BO¦CB¦¦²
 × ¦PO¦PC¦¦²
 × ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
to ¦PO¦PC¦¦ × ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ × ¦DO¦CD¦¦²
 × ¦BO¦CB¦¦²
, or as 2¦PO¦PC¦¦ to ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦. But with the points ¦Q¦¦ and ¦P¦¦
coming together, 2¦PO¦PC¦¦ and ¦vG¦G𝑣¦¦ are equal. Therefore, L × ¦QR¦¦ and ¦QT¦¦², which
are proportional to these, are also equal. Multiply these equals by ¦SP¦¦²&nbsp;/&nbsp;¦QR¦¦, and
L × ¦SP¦¦²
 will become equal to ¦SP¦¦² × ¦QT¦¦²&nbsp;/&nbsp;¦QR¦¦. Therefore
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop6,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary1">by prop. 6, corols, 1 and 5
</a>)
 the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely as L × ¦SP¦¦², that is, inversely as the
square of the distance ¦SP¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.I.

The ¦force¦¦ which tends toward ¦O¦the center¦¦ of ¦orbit¦the ellipse¦¦, and by which
¦P¦body P¦¦ can revolve in ¦orbit¦that ellipse¦¦, is
(<a target="_blank" 
href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop10,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary1">by 
prop. 10, corol. 1</a>)
as the distance ¦PO¦CP¦¦
of the body from the ¦O¦center C¦¦ of the ellipse; hence, if ¦EO¦CE¦¦ is drawn parallel to
the tangent ¦PR¦¦ of the ellipse and if ¦EO¦CE¦¦ and ¦SP¦PS¦¦ meet at ¦E¦¦, then the force by
which the same ¦P¦body P¦¦ can revolve around any other ¦S¦point S¦¦ of the ellipse
will
(<a target="_blank" 
href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop7,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary3">by 
prop. 7, corol. 3</a>)
be as ¦EP¦PE¦¦³&nbsp;/&nbsp;¦SP¦¦²; that is, if point ¦S¦¦ is a focus of the ellipse,
and therefore ¦EP¦PE¦¦ is given, this force will be inversely as ¦SP¦¦². &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.I.

This solution could be extended to the parabola and the hyperbola as
concisely as in <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop10">prop. 10</a>, but because of the importance of this problem and
its use in what follows, it will not be too troublesome to confirm each of
these other cases by a separate demonstration.
