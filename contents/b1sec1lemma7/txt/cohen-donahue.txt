With the same suppositions, I say that the ultimate ratios of the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦,
the ¦AB¦chord¦¦, and the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ ¦claimRatio¦to one another ¦¦ are ratios of equality.

For as the point ¦B¦¦ approaches the 
point ¦A¦¦, let ¦AB¦¦ and ¦AD¦¦ be 
understood always to be produced 
to the distant points ¦b¦𝑏¦¦ and ¦d¦𝑑¦¦, and let 
¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ be drawn 
parallel to the intersecting 
line ¦BD¦¦. And let the arc 
¦arc-Ab¦A𝑐𝑏¦¦ be always similar to the arc 
¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦. And, the points ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, 
coming together, the angle ¦Ab Ad *anch-color*proof¦𝑑A𝑏¦¦, by
the 
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6">previous lemma</a>,
vanishes; and therefore the straight lines ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦, ¦Ad¦A𝑑¦¦, always finite, and 
the arc ¦arc-Ab¦A𝑐𝑏¦¦ lying between them, coincide, and therefore ¦proofRatio¦will be equal¦¦. Therefore, both 
the straight lines ¦AB¦¦, ¦AD¦¦ always proportional to these, and the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ lying 
between, will vanish, and will have the ¦claimRatio¦ultimate ratio of equality¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Hence, if ¦BF BF-data¦BF¦¦ is drawn through ¦B¦¦ parallel to the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ 
and always cutting at ¦F¦¦ any straight line ¦AF¦¦ passing through ¦A¦¦, then ¦BF BF-data¦BF¦¦ 
will ultimately have a ratio of equality to the vanishing arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, because, if
parallelogram ¦AF BF AD BD¦AFBD¦¦ is completed, ¦BF BF-data¦BF¦¦ always has a ratio of equality to ¦AD¦¦.

And if through ¦B¦¦ and ¦A¦¦ additional straight lines ¦BE¦¦,
¦BD¦¦, ¦AF¦¦, and ¦AG¦¦ are drawn cutting the tangent ¦AD¦¦ and its parallel ¦BF¦¦, the
¦claimRatio¦ultimate ratios¦¦ of all the abscissas ¦AD¦¦, ¦AE¦¦, ¦BF¦¦, and ¦BG¦¦ and of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ 
and arc ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦ to one another will be ratios of equality.

And therefore all these lines can be used for one another
interchangeably in any argumentation concerning ultimate ratios.
