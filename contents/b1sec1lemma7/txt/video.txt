Using the same setup as lemma 6, 
when the ¦A B¦points¦¦ that determine the end of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ approach each other and meet, 
the lengths of the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, ¦AB¦chord¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ ultimately have ratios of equality.

For this proof, we create a ¦arc-Ab¦larger arc¦¦ that is similar to the ¦arc-AB¦original arc¦¦. 
We arrange this ¦arc-Ab¦larger arc¦¦ so that it shares a ¦A¦starting point¦¦ with the ¦arc-AB¦original arc¦¦, 
and its ¦Ab¦chord¦¦ overlays the ¦AB¦original chord¦¦. 
We now have a ¦arc-Ab Ab¦magnified version¦¦ of the ¦arc-AB AB¦original arc and chord¦¦. 
We extend the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ so that we have a ¦Ad¦magnified version of it¦¦ too. 
Notice that because the ¦arc-Ab arc-AB¦arcs¦¦ are similar, 
the ¦arc-Ab Ab Ad¦enlarged arc, chord, and tangent¦¦ are all proportional to the ¦arc-AB AB AD¦original¦¦. 
<br><br>

Now as we shorten the ¦arc-AB¦original arc¦¦, 
we keep the ¦arc-Ab¦larger arc¦¦ similar to it. 
So although the ¦arc-AB AB AD¦original arc, chord, and tangent¦¦ are vanishing, 
the ¦arc-Ab Ab Ad¦enlarged arc, chord, and tangent¦¦ are not. 
This lets us apply lemma 6 to know that the 
¦Ab Ad¦enlarged chord and tangent¦¦ will ultimately coincide and be equal. 
As the ¦arc-Ab¦enlarged arc¦¦ is trapped between them, 
¦arc-Ab Ab Ad¦all three¦¦ will coincide and have ratios of equality. 
<br><br>

As these ¦arc-Ab Ab Ad¦magnified components¦¦ are proportional to the 
¦AB arc-AB AD¦vanishing chord, tangent, and arc¦¦, 
we know that the ¦AB arc-AB AD¦vanishing components¦¦ will likewise coincide and have ratios of equality.

<span class="captured-reference id-colollary-1">Corollary 1</span>
draws a 
¦BF¦new line¦¦ parallel to the 
¦AD¦tangent¦¦ line from one of the 
¦AB¦chord¦¦’s 
¦B¦endpoints¦¦, then uses these lines to construct a 
¦AD BD AF BF¦parallelogram¦¦ by connecting these lines together.
Because the 
¦BF¦side¦¦ of the parallelogram which is opposite the 
tangent line is always the same length as the tangent line, 
it will also ultimately have a ratio of equality with the vanishing 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦.

<span class="captured-reference id-colollary-2">Corollary 2</span>
observes that had this 
¦AD BD AF BF¦parallelogram¦¦ been made with a 
¦AE¦shorter¦¦ or 
¦AD¦longer¦¦ tangent line, that the 
¦AE¦new tangent¦¦ line, along with its 
¦BG¦opposite side¦¦ in the parallelogram, would also ultimately have 
¦conterminousRatio¦ratios¦¦ of equality with the 
¦AB¦chord¦¦, 
¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, the 
¦AD¦original tangent¦¦ line, and its 
¦BF¦opposite side¦¦.

Corollary 3 observes that therefore 
¦AD BF AB arc-AB¦all these lines¦¦ can be used interchangeably when discussing ultimate ratios.
