With the same suppositions, I say that the ultimate ratios of the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦,
the ¦AB¦chord¦¦, and the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ ¦conterminousRatio¦to one another ¦¦ are ratios of equality.

For while point ¦B¦¦ <span class="captured-reference id-true-convergence-1">approaches</span> point ¦A¦¦, let ¦AB¦¦ and ¦AD¦¦ be understood
always to be produced to the distant points <i>¦b ¦¦</i> and <i>¦d¦d&hairsp;&hairsp;¦¦</i>; and let <i>¦bd ¦¦</i> be drawn
parallel to secant ¦BD¦¦. And let arc ¦arc-Ab¦A<i>cb </i>¦¦ be always similar to arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦. Then as
points ¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ come together, the angle
¦Ab Ad *anch-color*proof¦<i>d</i>A<i>b </i>¦¦ will vanish (by lem. 6), and thus the
straight lines ¦Ab¦A<i>b</i> ¦¦ and ¦Ad¦A<i>d&hairsp;&hairsp;</i> ¦¦ 
(which are always finite) and the intermediate arc ¦arc-Ab¦A<i>cb </i>¦¦
will coincide and therefore will be equal. Hence, the straight lines ¦AB¦¦ and
¦AD¦¦ and the intermediate arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ (which are always proportional to the
lines ¦Ab¦A<i>b </i>¦¦ and ¦Ad¦A<i>d </i>¦¦ and the arc ¦arc-Ab¦A<i>cb </i>¦¦ respectively) will also vanish and will
have to one another an ultimate ratio of equality. &nbsp; Q.E.D.

Hence, if ¦BF¦¦ is drawn through ¦B¦¦ parallel to the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦
and always cutting at ¦F¦¦ any straight line ¦AF¦¦ passing through ¦A¦¦, then ¦BF¦¦
will ultimately have a ratio of equality to the vanishing arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, because, if
parallelogram ¦AF BF AD BD *anch-color*given¦AFBD¦¦ is completed, ¦BF¦¦ always has a ratio of equality to ¦AD¦¦.

And if through ¦B¦¦ and ¦A¦¦ additional straight lines ¦BE¦¦,
¦BD¦¦, ¦AF¦¦, and ¦AG¦¦ are drawn cutting the tangent ¦AD¦¦ and its parallel ¦BF¦¦, the
¦conterminousRatio¦ultimate ratios¦¦ of all the abscissas ¦AD¦¦, ¦AE¦¦, ¦BF¦¦, and ¦BG¦¦ and of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦
and arc ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦ to one another will be ratios of equality.

And therefore all these lines can be used for one another
interchangeably in any argumentation concerning ultimate ratios.
