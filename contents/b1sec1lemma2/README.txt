D8D

Method:
lemmaD8D.pointWrap_2_dragWraps is used for both ctrlN and baseN sliders.
Pos are reverse calculated for ctrlN points to synch with poit2pointy core routine.
baseN do use medpos. baseN are not shown. Their twins, B,C, are made in synch with them and displayed.

Compliance with core:
A,B,C, a, b, ... are decorational representations twins of inner parts.
ctrlN and A,B,C, a, b, ... are partially configurable in sconf.js
