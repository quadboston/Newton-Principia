in "Euclid's Elements". Logical gaps in Ratios theory were filled by Dedekind 200 years after Newton by building numerical system of Real numbers which "embeds" Ratios.
<br><br>

Like in Euclid and in Newton time, properties of Ratios are inferred and applied from and to Geometrical models and suggested to other phenomenas like time or forces. Calculus and existence of ratio limits do rely on Geometrical intuition.
