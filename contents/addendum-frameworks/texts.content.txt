Axiomatic frameworks
<br><br>

<a name="Eframework"></a>
<b>"Euclid Framework".</b> Geometry and Ratios in "Euclid's Elements".
Rational numbers are build partially. Real numbers are not built explicitly and used in limited capability in form of ratios.

Apparently, existence of ratio limits and Calculus rely on Geometrical intuition.
<br><br>

Logical foundation is: Geometry and Ratios --&gt; Calculus --&gt; Physics
<br><br>

Magnitudes are not necessary numbers. In application to Phisics, we don't know what they are and don't make the dogma that they are numbers. They participate in relationship which is called "ratio".
<br><br>
F=ma is a heresy because m and a are ratios and multiplication is not defined for them,
geometirical reasoning as "area of m*a" called into help and, most important, m and a
have different nature and cannot be multiplied anyway.
<br><br>


<a name="Cframework"></a>
<b>"Calculus Framework"</b> which is build in XIX-XX centuries.
Logical foundation is: Axioms of set theory --&gt; Number theory --&gt; Rational and Real numbers --&gt; Calculus --&gt; Functional Analysysis --&gt; ... --&gt; Physics
<br><br>

In particular, limits defined in Bolzano-Weierstrass</b> epsion-delta language (first part of XIX century).
<br><br>

Magnitudes are measured as numbers. In Physics, we apply a dogma that everything can be represented with real numbers or their functions.
<br><br>

In Physics, we assume that some kinds of magnitudes have a unit in respect to which every
specie of the kind can be measured. Like time in time units, charge in charge units.
