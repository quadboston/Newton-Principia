If a ¦P body¦body¦¦ revolve in any ¦orbit¦¦ whatever about an inmobile center ¦S¦¦
in a non-resisting space, and describe any ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ you please just now nanscent, in the
¦dtime¦least possible time¦¦, and the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ of the ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ be understood to be drawn, which bisects ¦Q,rrminus chord¦the chord¦¦ and being produced passes through ¦S¦the center of forces¦¦, the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ in the middle of the ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ will be as
¦P,sagitta¦the sagitta¦¦ directly and the time twice inversely [i.e in the duplicate
ratio of the time].

For the ¦P,sagitta¦the sagitta¦¦ in the ¦dtime¦given time¦¦ is as the ¦force¦¦

(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop1,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-4">by Proposition 1 Corollary 4</a>),

and by increasing ¦dtime¦the time¦¦ in any ratio you please, because ¦timearc¦the arc¦¦
increases in the same ratio, the ¦P,sagitta¦the sagitta¦¦ is increased in the
duplicate of that ratio

(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma11,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-2">by Lemma 11 Corollary 2 and 3</a>).

Therefore, it is as the ¦force¦¦ once and ¦dtime¦the time¦¦ twice. Let the duplicate ratio of
¦dtime¦the time¦¦ be removed on both sides, and the ¦force¦¦ comes out to be as the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦
directly and the ¦dtime¦time¦¦ twice inversely. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.
<br><br>
The same thing is also easily demonstrated

(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma10,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-4">by Lemma 10 Corollary 4</a>).

If a ¦P¦body P¦¦ in revolving about ¦S¦center S¦¦ describe the ¦APQ¦curved line APQ¦¦,
while the ¦PZ PR¦straight line ZPR¦¦ touch ¦APQ¦that curve¦¦ at any point you please
¦P¦¦, and from any other point on the curve you please ¦Q¦¦ there be drawn ¦QR¦¦ to
the ¦PZ PR¦tangent¦¦ parallel to the distance ¦SP¦¦, and ¦QT¦¦ be dropped perpendicular
to that distance ¦SP¦¦, the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ will be inversely as the solid
sq.¦SP¦¦ x sq.¦QT¦¦ / ¦QR¦¦, provided that the quantity of that solid always be taken
which it has ultimately, when the points ¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ come
together. For ¦QR¦¦ is equal to the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ of
¦timearc¦double the arc QP¦¦ at whose
middle ¦P¦¦ is; and twice the triangle ¦SQ QP SP¦SQP¦¦, or ¦SP¦¦x¦QT¦¦, is propotional
to ¦dtime¦the time¦¦ in which that ¦timearc¦double arc¦¦ is described; and therefore may be
used to represent the ¦dtime¦time¦¦.

If the ¦orbit¦¦ is either a circle, or touches or cuts a ¦curvatureCircle¦circle¦¦ concentrically, that is, contains with a circle the least angle of contact or section, having the same curvature and the same ¦PC¦radius of curvature¦¦ at the point ¦P¦¦; and if ¦PV¦¦ be a chord of this ¦curvatureCircle¦circle¦¦, drawn from the ¦P¦body¦¦ through the ¦S¦centre of force¦¦; the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ will be reciprocally as the solid '¦SY¦¦'² x '¦PV¦¦'. For '¦PV¦¦' is '¦QP¦¦'² / '¦QR¦¦'.

Hence if any ¦orbit¦curvilinear figure APQ¦¦, be given, and in it be given also the point ¦S¦¦
to which the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is ¦SP¦always directed¦¦,
the law of ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ may be found by which ¦P¦any body you please P¦¦,
perpetually drawn back from a ¦PY¦rectilinear course¦¦, will be confined to
the ¦orbit¦perimeter of that figure¦¦, and will trace it out by revolving.

That is, one computes the solid sq.¦SP¦¦ x sq.¦QT¦¦ / ¦QR¦¦ ... [that is] inversely proportional to this ¦force¦¦.
We shall give example of this procedure in the following problems.
