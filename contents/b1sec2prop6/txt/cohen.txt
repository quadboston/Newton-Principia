If in a nonresisting space a ¦P¦body¦¦ revolves in any ¦orbit¦¦ about an immobile ¦S¦center¦¦
and describes any just-nascent ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ in a minimally small ¦dtime¦time¦¦, and if the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ of
the ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ is understood to be drawn so as to bisect the ¦Q,rrminus¦chord¦¦ and, when produced,
to pass through the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦, the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ in the middle of the ¦timearc¦arc¦¦
will be as the ¦P,sagitta¦the sagitta¦¦ directly and as the ¦dtime¦time¦¦ twice [i.e., as the square of the ¦dtime¦time¦¦]
inversely.

For the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ in a given ¦dtime¦time¦¦ is as the ¦force¦¦ (by 
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop1,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-4">prop. 1, corol. 4</a>),
and
if the ¦dtime¦time¦¦ is increased in any ratio, then—because the ¦timearc¦arc¦¦ is increased in the
same ratio—the ¦P,sagitta¦the sagitta¦¦ is increased in that ratio squared (by 
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma11,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-2">lem. 11, corols. 2
and 3</a>).
and therefore is as the ¦force¦¦ once and the ¦dtime¦time¦¦ twice [i.e., as the ¦force¦¦
and the square of the ¦dtime¦time¦¦ jointly]. Take away from both sides the squared
ratio of the ¦dtime¦time¦¦, and the ¦force¦¦ will become as the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ directly and as the
¦dtime¦time¦¦ twice [or as the square of the ¦dtime¦time¦¦] inversely. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.<br>
&emsp; This proposition is also easily proved by 
(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma10,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-4">lem. 10, corol. 4</a>).

If a body ¦P¦¦, revolving
about a center ¦S¦¦, describes the curved line
¦APQ¦¦, while the straight line ¦PZ PR¦ZPR¦¦ touches
the ¦APQ¦curve¦¦ at any point ¦P¦¦; and ¦QR¦¦, parallel 
to distance ¦SP¦¦, is drawn to the ¦PZ PR¦tangent¦¦
from any other point ¦Q¦¦ of the ¦APQ¦curve¦¦, and
¦QT¦¦ is drawn perpendicular to that distance 
¦SP¦¦; then the centripetal ¦force¦¦ will be inversely as the solid 

<!-- SP² × QT² / QR -->

provided that the magnitude of that solid is always taken as that which it
has ultimately when the points ¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ come together. For ¦QR¦¦ is equal to
the ¦P,sagitta¦sagitta¦¦ of an arc that is ¦timearc¦twice the length of arc QP¦¦, with ¦P¦¦ being in the
middle; and twice the triangle ¦SQ QP SP¦SQP¦¦ (or ¦SP¦¦ × ¦QT¦¦) is proportional to the ¦dtime¦time¦¦
in which ¦timearc¦twice that arc¦¦ is described and therefore can stand for the ¦dtime¦time¦¦.

If the orbit ¦orbit¦APQ¦¦ either is a circle or touches a ¦curvatureCircle¦circle¦¦
concentrically or cuts it concentrically—that is, if it makes with the ¦curvatureCircle¦circle¦¦ an
angle of contact or of section which is the least possible—and has the same
curvature and the same ¦PC¦radius of curvature¦¦ at point ¦P¦¦, and if the ¦curvatureCircle¦circle¦¦ has a
¦PV¦chord¦¦ drawn from the ¦P¦body¦¦ through the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦, then the centripetal
¦force¦¦ will be inversely as the solid ¦SY¦¦² × ¦PV¦¦. For ¦PV¦¦ is equal to 

<!-- QP² / QR -->

Hence, if there is given any curvilinear figure ¦orbit¦APQ¦¦ and
on it there is given also point ¦S¦¦, to which the centripetal ¦force¦¦ is continually
directed, the law of the centripetal ¦force¦¦ can be found by which any body
¦P¦¦, continually ¦QP¦drawn¦¦ away from a ¦PR¦rectilinear course¦¦, will be kept in the
perimeter of that figure and will describe it as an ¦orbit¦¦. That is, the solid

<!-- SP² × QT² / QR -->

or the solid ¦SY¦¦² × ¦PV¦¦, inversely proportional to this ¦force¦¦, is
to be found by computation. We will give examples of this in the following
problems.
