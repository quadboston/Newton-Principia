Thank you for rasing the question. They wake mind up.

"If f_ultimate is the same"

No. Not the same. The proportionality coefficient is M^2, (square of angular momentum).

Formulas (i.e. Ms ) all are different, depending on which measure of unit is chosen for time. 1/r^2 is for specific choice of this unit.

(And we just ignore mass for it will be introduced in the Book later.)

I must write detailed addendum following these questions.

PS: correcting error: was: ½M², correct: 2M².

We can consider 2 ultimate mathematical functions:

By the Book's numerical method: fₚ = lim QR / SP² x QT², 
By the modern numerical method: fₛ = dr²/dt² = 𝜎 (M/r)²/ρ⟂,

This is already discussed here (spring 2022?):
https://landkey.net/z/bs/nl9/demo/addk/addendum.prod.html?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop6,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=addendum,subessayId=corollary1

In less rigit language:

QR ~= ½fₛ(∆t)², (Taylor sequence)
fₛ ~= 2 QR/(∆t)²,
∆S/∆t = ½M (Kepler's area law),
fₛ ~= 2 QR/(∆S)²(½M)² ~= ½M² QR/(SP² x QT²/4),
fₛ = 2M² fₚ 

Proportionality coefficient is 2M².
