The ¦ABD ACE¦spaces¦¦ which a body describes when any finit force whatever urges [it], whether that force be determinate and immutable, or whether it be continually increased or continually decreased, are at
the very beginning of the motion in the ¦AD2PerAE2¦duplicated ratio of the times¦¦.

Let the times be displayed by the lines ¦AD¦¦, ¦AE¦¦,
and the generated velocities by the ordinates ¦DB¦¦, ¦EC¦¦:
and the spaces described by these velocities will be as the areas
¦ABD¦¦, ¦ACE¦¦ described by these ordinates, that is,
at the very beginning of the motion ( by Lemma 9 ),
in the ¦AD2PerAE2¦duplicate ratio¦¦ of times ¦AD¦¦, ¦AE¦¦.

Corollary 1.
<br><br>

And hence it is easily deduced that when bodies describe similar parts of similar figures in
proportional times, the deviations that are generated by any equal forces you please
similarily applied to the bodies, and that are measured by the ¦ACE¦distances¦¦ of the
bodies from those places of the similar figures to which the same bodies would have arrived
in the same ¦AD AE¦proportional times¦¦ without those forces, are as the squares of the times in
which they are generated, very nearly.
<br><br>
<br><br>

Corollary 2.
<br><br>
Further, the deviations which are generated by proportional forces similarly applied to similar parts
of similar figures, are as the forces and the squares of the times cojointly.
<br><br>
<br><br>

Corollary 3.
<br><br>
The same is to be understood of any spaces you please which the bodies
describe when different forces urge them. At the very beginning of the
motion, thse are as the forces and the squares of the times cojointly.
<br><br>
<br><br>

Corollary 4.
<br><br>
And for that reason, at the very beginning of the motion, the forces are
as the spaces described directly and the squares of the times inversely.
<br><br>
<br><br>

Corollary 5.
<br><br>
And the squares of the times are as the spaces described directly and the forces inversely.
