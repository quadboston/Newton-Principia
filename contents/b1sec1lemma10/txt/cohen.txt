The ¦ABD ACE¦spaces¦¦ which a body describes when urged by any finite force, whether
that force is determinate and immutable or is continually increased or continually
decreased, are at the very beginning of the motion in the ¦AD2PerAE2¦squared ratio of the
times¦¦.

Let the times be represented by lines ¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦¦, and the generated
velocities by ordinates ¦DB¦¦ and ¦EC¦¦; then the spaces described by these 
velocities will be as the areas ¦ABD¦¦ and ¦ACE¦¦ described by these ordinates, that
is, at the very beginning of the motion these spaces will be (by 
<a href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma9">lem. 9</a>) in the
¦AD2PerAE2¦squared ratio of the times¦¦ ¦AD¦¦ and ¦AE¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

And hence it is easily concluded that when bodies describe 
similar parts of similar figures in proportional times, the errors that
are generated by any equal forces similarly applied to the bodies, and that
are measured by the ¦ACE¦distances¦¦ of the bodies from those points on the similar
figures at which the same bodies would arrive in the same ¦AD AE¦proportional times¦¦
without these forces, are very nearly as the squares of the times in which they
are generated.

But the errors that are generated by proportional forces
similarly applied to similar parts of similar figures are as the forces and the
squares of the times jointly.

The same is to be understood of any spaces which bodies 
describe when different forces urge them. These spaces are, at the very
beginning of the motion, as the forces and the squares of the times jointly.

And thus the forces are as the spaces described at the very
beginning of the motion directly and as the squares of the times inversely.

And the squares of the times are directly as the spaces
described and inversely as the forces.
