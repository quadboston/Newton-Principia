Geometical shapes which belong to the topic
are accented when topic's link is hovered.

Accented means

    for dots:   they are thickened,
    for curves: they are thickened,
    for areas:  they have less opacity,

Colors are assigned in two ways:
    manually and
    automatic.

    Manual assigment is preset in content-script as "fixed-colors".
    For recent lemmas: - in sconf.js

    If no manual color is set: the color is elected automatically:
    different colors for different topics.

    Recent lemmas are trying to make colors consistent:

        black for context and for diagram environment,
        green for given geometrics,
        blue for proof (artificial) constructs,
        red for results.

    For example, l6,7,11.
    This policy is not implemented for all lemmas.



    Colors should depend on lemma content.

    For example, it is hard to follow given-proof-result pattern in theorem 1.

    In this theorem colors defined by
    physics matters: by laws on interaction of force and body:
    free-movment is green, free-move-areas - green, acting forces in red, inpulse in orange,
    constructed path - blue, constructed area - blue.

    In regards context-given-proof-result pattern, I mean colors match not only points by everything.

    Context, neutral, environment - black: for example, axes in "derivative.png" example, L6.
    Given material: given curve, given line, given area - green.
    Intermediate shapes, proof constructs - blue. Or multiple colors if lemma is complex.
    Final result: ultimate position, limit, final construct, final angle - red

    L6, 7, 11, 5 follow black-green-blue-red pattern.

    In lemma 9 there are 4 types of areas. Two given for curve and right-line triangle,
    two final for curve and right-line triangle.
    Two given areas cannot have the same green color.

    L9, 20, 21 - have randomly generated colors. They are earlier lemmas and did not have
    color policy.
