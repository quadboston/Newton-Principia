<b>Kepler Task</b>
<br><br>

For given ¦orbit¦¦ and point ¦S¦¦, find force which is directed to point ¦S¦¦ and makes ¦P¦body¦¦
moving along this ¦orbit¦¦. Body's mass is 1.
<br><br>

<b><i>Analysis for arbitrary speed</i></b>
<br><br>
Consider "roller-coaster" bound to ¦orbit¦¦ without friction. For arbitrary twice differetiable speed function v(s), one can always find force 𝗳(s) which makes body moving along this ¦orbit¦¦ with this speed. "s" is orbit's length parameter.
<br><br>

<i>Proof sketch.</i>
Tangent acceleration must be
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        aᵤ = v˙ = v'ₛs˙ = v'ₛv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*)
    </div>

If to establish this acceleration along the path s and if to use starting
value of speed v(s(tₒ)) at time tₒ, then calculated speed will be equal to v(t).
In other words, applied tangent force aᵤ will cause coaster to
move along orbit with given speed.
<br><br>

Normal acceleration will be aₙ = κv².
Full force acting on the body will be
    <div style="text-align:center;">
             𝗳(s) = 𝗮 = aᵤ𝘂 + aₙ𝗻.
    </div>
<br><br>

<b><i>I. Analysis for constant sector speed</i></b>
<br><br>
<b><i>I.1. Context.</i></b>

Now instead of arbitrary speed, take speed v which makes sector speed constant.

    <div style="text-align:center;">
        1/2[𝗿𝘃]𝗸 = 1/2 vr[<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curveXX,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=calculus-xx">𝗲𝘂</a>]<sub>𝗸</sub> = K = const,

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(k)<br>
    </div>
<br>

We may use following notations:<br>
Angles:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ω is angle from 𝗲 to 𝘂. 𝛺 =ᵈᶠ sin(ω) = [𝗲𝘂]𝗸, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; θ is angle from 𝗻 to 𝗲. 𝛳 =ᵈᶠ cos(θ) = -𝗲𝗻 = 𝛺 𝗯<sub>𝗸</sub>, <br>
  when recalling that 𝗯 = [𝘂𝗻] is a binormal and 𝗯𝗸 = 𝗯<sub>𝗸</sub> is either 1 or -1. <br>
<br>

<b><i>I.2. Solution.</i></b>
By differentiating (k), we find [𝗿𝗮] = 0 and 𝗳 // 𝗲. Hence our two starting equations are:
<br>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
             𝗳 = -𝗲f<sub>e</sub>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) <br>
        rv𝛺 = 2K. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (k')<br>
     </div>
<br>

We project force (f) on to curvature's norm 𝗻
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        -𝗲𝗻f<sub>e</sub> = κv², or
                    𝛺 𝗯<sub>𝗸</sub>f<sub>e</sub> = κv², &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f') <br>
     </div>
<br>

and, excluding v by substituting (k') into (f'), we obtain solution for
f<sub>e</sub> dependent only on shape of the orbit:
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        r²𝛺³𝗯<sub>𝗸</sub>f<sub>e</sub> = κ4K², &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (s) <br>
     </div>
<br>
All magnitudes in (s) are functions of curve's length parameter s. All functions except f<sub>e</sub> are known.
<br><br>

We restrict domain of definition of solution 𝗳(s) on pieces of orbit
[s₋ + ε, s₊ - ε] where s₋, s₊ are the points where 𝗿 // 𝘃. At these points, sector
speed must be 0, so Kepler's law would be broken. Preserving Kepler's law
in neighbourhoods like (s₋, s₋ + ε) would require "infinite" force which is
out of scope in our essay.
