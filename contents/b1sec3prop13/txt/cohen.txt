Let a ¦P¦body¦¦ move in the perimeter of a ¦orbit¦parabola¦¦; it is required to find the law of
the centripetal ¦force¦¦ tending toward a ¦S¦focus¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦figure¦¦.

Let the construction be the same as in lem. 14, and let ¦P¦P be the body¦¦ in
the perimeter of the ¦orbit¦parabola¦¦; from the ¦Q¦place Q¦¦ into which the body moves
next, draw ¦QR¦¦ parallel and ¦QT¦¦ perpendicular to ¦SP¦¦ and draw ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ parallel
to the ¦PR P,Zminus¦tangent¦¦ and meeting both the diameter ¦GP¦PG¦¦ in ¦v¦𝑣¦¦ and
the distance ¦SP¦¦
in ¦x¦𝑥¦¦. Now, because triangles ¦Px Pv xv¦P𝑥𝑣¦¦ and ¦SP PM SM¦SPM¦¦ are similar and
the sides ¦SM¦¦
and ¦SP¦¦ of the one are equal, the sides ¦Px¦P𝑥¦¦ or ¦QR¦¦ and ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ of the other are
equal. But from the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://whistleralley.com/conics/conica/Rosenfeld/Books1-7new.pdf#page=14"><i>Conics</i></a>
the square of the ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ is equal to the
rectangle contained by the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ and the segment ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ of the diameter,
that is 
(by lem. 13), 
equal to the rectangle 4¦SP¦PS¦¦ × ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦, or 4¦SP¦PS¦¦ × ¦QR¦¦, and, the
points ¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ coming together, the ratio of ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ to ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦ 
(by <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma7,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=cor-2">lem. 7, corol. 2</a>),
becomes the ratio of equality. Therefore, in this case ¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦²
 is equal to the
rectangle 4¦SP¦PS¦¦ × ¦QR¦¦. Moreover (because triangles ¦Qx Tx QT¦Q𝑥T¦¦ and ¦SP NS NP¦SPN¦¦ are similar),
¦Qx¦Q𝑥¦¦²
 is to ¦QT¦¦²
 as ¦SP¦PS¦¦²
 to ¦NS¦SN¦¦²
, that is 
(by lem. 14, corol. 1),
 as ¦SP¦PS¦¦ to ¦SA¦¦,
that is, as 4¦SP¦PS¦¦ × ¦QR¦¦ to 4¦SA¦¦ × ¦QR¦¦, and hence 
(by <a target="_blank" href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookV/propV9.html">Euclid's Elements, book 5, prop. 9</a>)
 ¦QT¦¦²
 and 4¦SA¦¦ × ¦QR¦¦ are equal. Multiply these equals by

<!-- SP² / QR -->
<math><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>
¦SP¦¦</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mi>

and

will become equal to ¦SP¦¦² × 4¦SA¦¦;
and therefore 
(by <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop6,logic_phaseId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary1">prop. 6, corols. 1 and 5</a>),
the centripetal force is inversely as ¦SP¦¦²
 × 4¦SA¦¦, that is,
because 4¦SA¦¦ is given, inversely as the square of the distance ¦SP¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.I.

From the last three propositions it follows that if any
¦P¦body P¦¦ departs from the ¦P¦place P¦¦ along any ¦PR¦straight line PR¦¦ with any velocity
whatever and is at the same time acted upon by ¦Px force¦a centripetal force¦¦ that is
inversely proportional to the square of the distance of places from the center,
¦P¦this body¦¦ will move in ¦orbit¦some one of the conies¦¦ having ¦S¦a focus¦¦ in the center
of forces; and conversely. For if ¦O¦the focus¦¦ and the point of contact and the
position of ¦P,Zminus PR¦the tangent¦¦ are given, ¦orbit¦a conic¦¦ can be described that will have
a given curvature at that point. But the curvature is given from the given
¦force Px¦centripetal force¦¦ and velocity of the body; and two different orbits touching
each other cannot be described with the same centripetal force and the same
velocity.

*..*

If the velocity with which the body departs from its ¦P¦place P¦¦ is
such that the ¦PR¦line-element PR¦¦ can be described by it in some minimally
small particle of time, and if the centripetal ¦force¦¦ is able to move the same
body through space ¦QR¦¦ in that same time, this body will move in
¦orbit¦some conic¦¦ whose principal ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ is the quantity ¦QT¦¦² / ¦QR¦¦ which ultimately
results when the line-elements ¦PR¦¦ and ¦QR¦¦ are diminished indefinitely. In
these corollaries I include the circle along with the ellipse, but not for the
case where the body descends straight down to a center.
