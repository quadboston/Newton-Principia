Let a body move in the perimeter of a parabola; it is required to find the law of
the centripetal force tending toward a focus of the figure.

Let the construction be the same as in lem. 14, and let P be the body in
the perimeter of the parabola; from the place Q into which the body moves
next, draw QR parallel and QT perpendicular to SP and draw Qv parallel
to the tangent and meeting both the diameter PG in v and the distance SP
in x. Now, because triangles Pxv and SPM are similar and the sides SM
and SP of the one are equal, the sides Px or QR and Pv of the other are
equal. But from the Conies the square of the ordinate Qv is equal to the
rectangle contained by the latus rectum and the segment Pv of the diameter,
that is (by lem. 13), equal to the rectangle 4PS x Pv, or 4PS x QR, and, the
points P and Q coming together, the ratio of Qz/ to Qx (by lem. 7, corol.
2) becomes the ratio of equality. Therefore, in this case Qx2
 is equal to the
rectangle 4PS x QR. Moreover (because triangles QxT and SPN are similar),
Q*2
 is to QT2
 as PS2
 to SN2
, that is (by lem. 14, corol. 1), as PS to SA,
that is, as 4PS x QR to 4SA x QR, and hence (by Euclid's Elements, book
SP2
5, prop. 9) QT2
 and 4SA x QR are equal. Multiply these equals by ,
QR
SP2
 x QT2
and will become equal to SP2
 x 4SA; and therefore (by prop.
QR
6, corols. 1 and 5) the centripetal force is inversely as SP2
 x 4SA, that is,
because 4SA is given, inversely as the square of the distance SP. Q.E.I.

From the last three propositions it follows that if any
body P departs from the place P along any straight line PR with any velocity
whatever and is at the same time acted upon by a centripetal force that is
inversely proportional to the square of the distance of places from the center,
this body will move in some one of the conies having a focus in the center
of forces; and conversely. For if the focus and the point of contact and the
position of the tangent are given, a conic can be described that will have
a given curvature at that point. But the curvature is given from the given
centripetal force and velocity of the body; and two different orbits touching
each other cannot be described with the same centripetal force and the same
velocity

If the velocity with which the body departs from its place
P is such that the line-element PR can be described by it in some minimally
small particle of time, and if the centripetal force is able to move the same
body through space QR in that same time, this body will move in some
QT2
conic whose principal latus rectum is the quantity which ultimately
QR
results when the line-elements PR and QR are diminished indefinitely. In
these corollaries I include the circle along with the ellipse, but not for the
case where the body descends straight down to a center.
