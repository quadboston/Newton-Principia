Supposing that the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the square of the
Problem 9 distance of places from the center and that the absolute quantity of this force is
known, it is required to find the line which a body describes when going forth
from a given place with a given velocity along a given straight line.

Let the centripetal force tending toward a point S be such that a body p
revolves by its action in any given orbit pq, and let its velocity in the place p
be found out. Let body P go forth from place P along line PR with a given
velocity and thereupon be deflected from that line into a conic PQ under
the compulsion of the centripetal force. Therefore the straight line PR will
touch this conic at P. Let some straight line pr likewise touch the orbit pq
at /?, and if perpendiculars are understood to be dropped from S to these
tangents, the principal latus rectum of the conic will (by prop. 16, corol. 1)
be to the principal latus rectum of the orbit in a ratio compounded of the
squares of the perpendiculars and the squares of the velocities and thus is

given. Let L be the latus rectum of the conic. The focus S of the conic is
also given. Let angle RPH be the complement of angle RPS to two right
angles [i.e., the supplement of angle RPS]; then the line PH, on which the
other focus H is located, will be given in position. Drop the perpendicular
SK to PH and understand the conjugate semiaxis BC to be erected; then
SP2 - 2KP x PH + PH2 = SH2 = 4CH2 = 4BH2 - 4BC2 = (SP + PH)2 -
L x (SP + PH) = SP2 + 2SP x PH + PH2 - L x (SP + PH). Add to each side
2(KP x PH) - SP2 - PH2 + L x (SP + PH), and L x (SP + PH) will become
= 2(SP x PH) + 2(KP x PH), or SP + PH will be to PH as 2SP + 2KP to L.
Hence PH is given in length as well as in position. Specifically, if the velocity
of the body at P is such that the latus rectum L is less than 2SP + 2KP, PH
will lie on the same side of the tangent PR as the line PS; and thus the figure
will be an ellipse and will be given from the given foci S and H and the
given principal axis SP + PH. But if the velocity of the body is so great that
the latus rectum L is equal to 2SP + 2KP, the length PH will be infinite; and
accordingly the figure will be a parabola having its axis SH parallel to the
line PK, and hence will be given. But if the body goes forth from its place
P with a still greater velocity, the length PH will have to be taken on the
other side of the tangent; and thus, since the tangent goes between the foci,
the figure will be a hyperbola having its principal axis equal to the difference
of the lines SP and PH, and hence will be given. For if the body in these
cases revolves in a conic thus found, it has been demonstrated in props. 11,
12, and 13 that the centripetal force will be inversely as the square of the
distance of the body from the center of forces S; and thus the line PQ is
correctly determined, which a body will describe under the action of such a
force, when it goes forth from a given place P with a given velocity along a
straight line PR given in position. Q.E.F.

Hence in every conic, given the principal vertex D, the
latus rectum L, and a focus S, the other focus H is given when DH is taken
to DS as the latus rectum is to the difference between the latus rectum and
4DS. For the proportion SP + PH to PH as 2SP + 2KP to L in the case of
this corollary becomes DS + DH to DH as 4DS to L and, by separation [or
dividendo], becomes DS to DH as 4DS â€” L to L.

Hence, given the velocity of a body in the principal vertex
D, the orbit will be found expeditiously, namely, by taking its latus rectum to
twice the distance DS as the square of the ratio of this given velocity to the
velocity of a body revolving in a circle at a distance DS (by prop. 16, corol.
3), and then taking DH to DS as the latus rectum to the difference between
the latus rectum and 4DS.

Hence also, if a body moves in any conic whatever and
is forced out of its orbit by any impulse, the orbit in which it will afterward
pursue its course can be found. For by compounding the body's own motion
with that motion which the impulse alone would generate, there will be
found the motion with which the body will go forth from the given place of
impulse along a straight line given in position.

And if the body is continually perturbed by some force
impressed from outside, its trajectory can be determined very nearly, by noting the changes which the force introduces at certain points and estimating
from the order of the sequence the continual changes at intermediate places.3

If a body P, under the action of a centripetal force tending toward any given
point R, moves in the perimeter of any
given conic whatever, whose center is
C, and the law of the centripetal force
is required, let CG be drawn parallel to
the radius RP and meeting the tangent
PG of the orbit at G; then the force
(by prop. 10, corol. 1 and schol.; and
CG3
prop. 7, corol. 3) will be as -.
a. The sense of corol. 4 is that Newton can determine "the changes which the [impressed] force
will make at certain points" and, by interpolation, estimate the changes continually made at intermediary
points.
