Supposing that the centripetal ¦p,f¦force¦¦ is inversely proportional to the square of the
¦Sp SP¦distance of places¦¦ from the ¦S¦center¦¦ and that the absolute quantity of this ¦p,f¦force¦¦ is
known, it is required to find the ¦orbit¦line¦¦ which a ¦P¦body¦¦ describes when going forth
from a ¦P¦given place¦¦ with a given ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ along a ¦P,vb¦given straight line¦¦.

Let the centripetal ¦p,f¦force¦¦ tending toward a point ¦S¦¦ be such that a body ¦p¦¦
revolves by its action in any given orbit ¦orbit-sample¦pq¦¦, and let its ¦p,vSample¦velocity¦¦ in the place ¦p¦¦
be found out. Let body ¦P¦¦ go forth from place ¦P¦¦ along line ¦P,vb¦PR¦¦ with a given
¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ and thereupon be deflected from that line into a conic ¦orbit¦PQ¦¦ under
the compulsion of the centripetal ¦p,f¦force¦¦. Therefore the straight line ¦P,vb¦PR¦¦ will
touch this ¦orbit¦conic¦¦ at ¦P¦¦. Let some straight line ¦p,vSample¦pr¦¦ likewise touch the orbit ¦orbit-sample¦pq¦¦
at ¦p¦¦, and if ¦S,Ys SY¦perpendiculars¦¦ are understood to be dropped from ¦S¦¦ to
¦p,vSample P,vb¦these tangents¦¦,
the principal ¦L,LL¦latus rectum of the conic¦¦ will (by prop. 16, corol. 1)
be to the principal ¦l,ll¦latus rectum of the orbit¦¦ in a ratio compounded of the
squares of the ¦S,Ys SY¦perpendiculars¦¦ and the squares of the ¦p,vSample P,vb¦velocities¦¦ and thus is 
given. Let L be the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum of the conic¦¦. The focus ¦S¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦conic¦¦ is
also given. Let angle ¦P,vb PH¦RPH¦¦ be the complement of angle ¦P,vb SP¦RPS¦¦ to two right
angles [i.e., the supplement of angle ¦P,vb SP¦RPS¦¦]; then the line ¦PH¦¦, on which the
other focus ¦H¦¦ is located, will be given in position. 
<br><br>
Drop the perpendicular
¦SK¦¦ to ¦PH¦¦ and understand the conjugate semiaxis ¦CB¦BC¦¦ to be erected; then

<table class="math-table">
  <tr><td style="text-align: right;">¦SP¦¦²&nbsp;−&nbsp;2¦PK¦KP¦¦&nbsp;×&nbsp;¦PH¦¦&nbsp;+&nbsp;¦PH¦¦²</td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>

    <td>¦SP¦¦² + 2¦SP¦¦ × ¦PH¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦² − ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ × (¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦). </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Add to each side
2(¦PK¦KP¦¦ × ¦PH¦¦) − ¦SP¦¦² − ¦PH¦¦² + ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ × (¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦), and ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ × (¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦) will become
= 2(¦SP¦¦ × ¦PH¦¦) + 2(¦PK¦KP¦¦ × ¦PH¦¦), or ¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦ will be to ¦PH¦¦ as 2¦SP¦¦ + 2¦PK¦KP¦¦ to ¦L,LL¦L¦¦.
Hence ¦PH¦¦ is given in length as well as in position.
<br><br>
Specifically, if the ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦
of the body at ¦P¦¦ is such that the latus rectum ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ is less than 2¦SP¦¦ + 2¦PK¦KP¦¦, ¦PH¦¦
will lie on the same side of the tangent ¦P,vb¦PR¦¦ as the line ¦SP¦PS¦¦; and thus the ¦orbit¦figure¦¦
will be an ellipse and will be given from the given foci ¦S¦¦ and ¦H¦¦ and the
given principal axis ¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦. But if the ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ of the ¦P¦body¦¦ is so great that
the latus rectum ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ is equal to 2¦SP¦¦ + 2¦PK¦KP¦¦, the length ¦PH¦¦ will be infinite; and
accordingly the ¦orbit¦figure¦¦ will be a parabola having its axis ¦CS CH¦SH¦¦ parallel to the
line ¦PK¦¦, and hence will be given. But if the ¦P¦body¦¦ goes forth from its place
¦P¦¦ with a still greater ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦, the length ¦PH¦¦ will have to be taken on the
other side of the ¦P,vb¦tangent¦¦; and thus, since the ¦P,vb¦tangent¦¦ goes between the ¦S H¦foci¦¦,
the ¦orbit¦figure¦¦ will be a hyperbola having its principal axis equal to the difference
of the lines ¦SP¦¦ and ¦PH¦¦, and hence will be given. 
<br><br>
For if the ¦P¦body¦¦ in these
cases revolves in a ¦orbit¦conic¦¦ thus found, it has been demonstrated in props.
<a href="?conf=sappId=b1sec3prop11">11</a>,
<a href="?conf=sappId=b1sec3prop12">12</a>, and
<a href="?conf=sappId=b1sec3prop13">13</a>,
that the centripetal ¦p,f¦force¦¦ will be inversely as the square of the
distance of the ¦P¦body¦¦ from the center of forces ¦S¦¦; and thus the line ¦orbit¦PQ¦¦ is
correctly determined, which a ¦P¦body¦¦ will describe under the action of such a
¦p,f¦force¦¦, when it goes forth from a given place ¦P¦¦ with a given ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ along a
straight line ¦P,vb¦PR¦¦ given in position. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.F.

Hence in every ¦orbit¦conic¦¦, given the principal vertex ¦D¦¦, the
latus rectum ¦L,LL¦L¦¦, and a focus ¦S¦¦, the other focus ¦H¦¦ is given when ¦DH¦¦ is taken
to ¦DS¦¦ as the latus rectum is to the difference between the latus rectum and
4¦DS¦¦. For the proportion ¦SP¦¦ + ¦PH¦¦ to ¦PH¦¦ as 2¦SP¦¦ + 2¦PK¦KP¦¦ to ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ in the case of
this corollary becomes ¦DS¦¦ + ¦DH¦¦ to ¦DH¦¦ as 4¦DS¦¦ to ¦L,LL¦L¦¦ and, by separation [or
dividendo], becomes ¦DS¦¦ to ¦DH¦¦ as 4¦DS¦¦&nbsp;−&nbsp;¦L,LL¦L¦¦ to ¦L,LL¦L¦¦.

Hence, given the ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ of a ¦P¦body¦¦ in the principal vertex
¦D¦¦, the orbit will be found expeditiously, namely, by taking its ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ to
twice the distance ¦DS¦¦ as the square of the ratio of this given ¦P,vb¦velocity¦¦ to the
velocity of a body revolving in a circle at a distance ¦DS¦¦ (by prop. 16, corol.
3), and then taking ¦DH¦¦ to ¦DS¦¦ as the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ to the difference between
the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ and 4¦DS¦¦.
