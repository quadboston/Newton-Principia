In all ¦curve-AB¦curves¦¦ having a ¦AJ¦finite curvature¦¦ at the ¦A¦point of contact¦¦, the vanishing
¦BD¦subtense¦¦ of the ¦AD arc-AB¦angle of contact¦¦ is ultimately in the squared ratio of the ¦AB¦subtense¦¦
of the ¦arc-AB¦conterminous arc¦¦.

Let ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦ be the arc, ¦AD¦¦ its tangent, ¦BD¦¦ the subtense of the ¦AD arc-AB¦angle
of contact¦¦ perpendicular to the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ [angle ¦AD arc-AB¦BAD¦¦], and [the line] ¦AB¦¦ the
subtense [i.e., the conterminous chord] of the arc [¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦].
Erect ¦BG¦¦ and ¦AG¦¦ perpendicular to this subtense ¦AB¦¦
and tangent ¦AD¦¦ and meeting in ¦G¦¦; then let points ¦D¦¦,
¦B¦¦, and ¦G¦¦ approach points ¦d¦𝑑¦¦, ¦b¦𝑏¦¦, and ¦g¦𝑔¦¦, and let ¦J¦¦ be
the intersection of lines ¦BG¦¦ and ¦AG¦¦, which ultimately
occurs when points ¦D¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ reach ¦A¦¦. 
<br><br>
It is evident that
the distance ¦GJ¦¦ can be less than any assigned distance.
And (from the nature of the circles passing through
points ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦G¦¦ and ¦A¦¦, ¦b¦𝑏¦¦, ¦g¦𝑔¦¦) ¦AB¦¦² is equal to ¦AG¦¦ × ¦BD¦¦,
and ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is equal to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ × ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦, and thus the ratio of ¦AB¦¦²
to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is compounded of the ratios of ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ and
¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦. But since ¦GJ¦¦ can be taken as less than any assigned length, it can
happen that the ratio of ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ differs from the ratio of equality by less
than any assigned difference, and thus that the ratio of ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² differs
from the ratio of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ by less than any assigned difference. Therefore,
by lem. 1, the ultimate ratio of ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is the same as the ultimate ratio
of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Now let ¦BD¦¦ be inclined to ¦AD¦¦ at any given angle, and the
ultimate ratio of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ will always be the same as before and thus the
same as ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦². &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

And even when angle ¦AD BD¦D¦¦ is not given, if the straight line ¦BD¦¦
converges to a given point or is drawn according to any ¦limitRatio¦other specification¦¦,
still the angles ¦AD BD¦D¦¦ and ¦Ad bd¦𝑑¦¦ (constructed according to the specification common
to both) will always tend to equality and will approach each other so closely
that their difference will be less than any assigned quantity, and thus will
ultimately be equal, by lem. 1; and therefore lines ¦BD¦¦ and ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ are in the
same ratio to each other as before. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

COR. 1. Hence, since the tangents ¦AD¦¦, ¦Ad¦¦,
the arcs ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦, ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦, and their sines, ¦BC¦¦, ¦bc¦¦,
become ultimately equal to the chords ¦AB¦¦, ¦Ab¦¦,
their squares will also be ultimately as the subtenses ¦BD¦¦, ¦bd¦¦.
<br><br><br>

COR. 2. The squares of the same are also ultimately as the sagittae of the arcs which
bisect the chords and converge to a given point. For these sagittae are as the subtenses
BD, bd.
<br><br><br>



COR. 3. Therefore, the sagitta is in the duplicate ratio of the time in which
a given body describes the arc with a given velocity.
<br><br><br>

COR. 4. The rectilinear triangles ADB, Adb are ultimately in the triplicate ratio of the sides AD, Ad,
and in a sesquiplicate ratio of the sides DB, db; as being in the ratio compounded of the sides AD to DB,
and of Ad to db.

So also the triangles ABC, Abe
are ultimately in the triplicate ratio of the sides BC, bc. What I call the sesquiplicate ratio is the subduplicate
of the triplicate, as being compounded of the simple
and subduplicate ratio.
<br><br><br>

COR. 5. And because DB, db are ultimately parallel
and in the duplicate ratio of the lines AD, Ad, the
ultimate curvilinear areas ADB, Adb will be (by the nature of the parabola)
two thirds of the rectilinear triangles ADB, Adb and the segments
AB, Ab will be
one third

<!-- KVK: does not make sense. This makes sense: AD ~ area^(1/3) -->

of the same triangles. And thence those areas and those segments will be in the triplicite ratio as well of the tangents
AD, Ad, as of the chords and arcs AB, AB.
