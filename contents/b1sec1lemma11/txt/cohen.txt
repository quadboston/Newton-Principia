In all ¦curve-AB¦curves¦¦ having a ¦AJ¦finite curvature¦¦ at the ¦A¦point of contact¦¦, the vanishing
¦BD¦subtense¦¦ of the ¦AD arc-AB¦angle of contact¦¦ is ultimately in the squared ratio of the ¦AB¦subtense¦¦
of the ¦arc-AB¦conterminous arc¦¦.

Let ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦ be the arc, ¦AD¦¦ its tangent, ¦BD¦¦ the subtense of the ¦AD arc-AB¦angle
of contact¦¦ perpendicular to the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ [angle ¦AD arc-AB¦BAD¦¦], and [the line] ¦AB¦¦ the
subtense [i.e., the conterminous chord] of the arc [¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦].
Erect ¦BG¦¦ and ¦AG¦¦ perpendicular to this subtense ¦AB¦¦
and tangent ¦AD¦¦ and meeting in ¦G¦¦; then let points ¦D¦¦,
¦B¦¦, and ¦G¦¦ approach points ¦d¦𝑑¦¦, ¦b¦𝑏¦¦, and ¦g¦𝑔¦¦, and let ¦J¦¦ be
the intersection of lines ¦BG¦¦ and ¦AG¦¦, which ultimately
occurs when points ¦D¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ reach ¦A¦¦. 
<br><br>
It is evident that
the distance ¦GJ¦¦ can be less than any assigned distance.
And (from the nature of the circles passing through
points ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦G¦¦ and ¦A¦¦, ¦b¦𝑏¦¦, ¦g¦𝑔¦¦) ¦AB¦¦² is equal to ¦AG¦¦ × ¦BD¦¦,
and ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is equal to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ × ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦, and thus the ratio of ¦AB¦¦²
to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is compounded of the ratios of ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ and
¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦. But since ¦GJ¦¦ can be taken as less than any assigned length, it can
happen that the ratio of ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦A𝑔¦¦ differs from the ratio of equality by less
than any assigned difference, and thus that the ratio of ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² differs
from the ratio of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ by less than any assigned difference. Therefore,
by lem. 1, the ultimate ratio of ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦² is the same as the ultimate ratio
of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Now let ¦BD¦¦ be inclined to ¦AD¦¦ at any given angle, and the
ultimate ratio of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ will always be the same as before and thus the
same as ¦AB¦¦² to ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦². &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

And even when angle ¦AD BD¦D¦¦ is not given, if the straight line ¦BD¦¦
converges to a given point or is drawn according to any ¦limitRatio¦other specification¦¦,
still the angles ¦AD BD¦D¦¦ and ¦Ad bd¦𝑑¦¦ (constructed according to the specification common
to both) will always tend to equality and will approach each other so closely
that their difference will be less than any assigned quantity, and thus will
ultimately be equal, by lem. 1; and therefore lines ¦BD¦¦ and ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦ are in the
same ratio to each other as before. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Hence, since tangents ¦AD¦¦ and ¦Ad¦A𝑑¦¦, arcs ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦arc-Ab¦A𝑏¦¦, and
their sines ¦BC¦¦ and ¦bc¦𝑏𝘤¦¦ become ultimately equal to chords ¦AB¦¦ and ¦Ab¦A𝑏¦¦, their
squares will also be ultimately as the subtenses ¦BD¦¦ and ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦.

The squares of these ¦AD Ad¦tangents¦¦, ¦arc-AB arc-Ab¦arcs¦¦, and ¦BC bc¦sines¦¦ are also
ultimately as the sagittas of the ¦arc-AB arc-Ab¦arcs¦¦, which bisect the ¦AB Ab¦chords¦¦ and converge
to a given point. For these sagittas are as the subtenses ¦BD¦¦ and ¦bd¦𝑏𝑑¦¦.

And thus the sagitta is in the squared ratio of the time
in which a body describes the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ with a given velocity.
