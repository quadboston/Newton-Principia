The evanescent ¦BD¦subtense¦¦ of the ¦AD curve-AB¦angle of contact¦¦, in all curves 
¦AJ¦having a finite¦¦ curvature at the point of contact, is ultimately in the
duplicate ratio of the ¦AB¦subtense¦¦ of the ¦arc-AB¦conterminous arc¦¦.

*..*

CASE 1. Let that arc be ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦, its tangent ¦AD¦¦,
the subtense of the angle of contact perpendicular to the tangent ¦BD¦¦,
subtense of the arc ¦AB¦¦.
<br><br>

Let ¦AG¦¦, ¦BG¦¦ be erected perpendicular to the latter subtense ¦AB¦¦ and to the
tangent ¦AD¦¦,
meeting at ¦G¦¦, and then let the points ¦D¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦G¦¦, come to the points
¦d¦¦, ¦b¦¦, ¦g¦¦, and let ¦J¦¦ be
the intersection of the lines ¦BG¦¦, ¦AG¦¦, occuring ultimately,
where the points ¦D¦¦, ¦B¦¦ come all
the way to ¦A¦¦.
<br><br>


It is obvious that the distance ¦GJ¦¦ can be less than any assigned [magnitude]
you please. <!-- KVK: this is not obvious: this is the assumption of the theorem ===
curve has finite curvature ~ the curve has limit J; or it can be a theorem on itself
if define "finite curvature" different way like as "second order Taylor member is not zero"
 -->
<br><br>

Now, by the nature of circles passing through the points ¦A B G¦ABG¦¦, ¦A b g¦Abg¦¦, square ¦AB¦¦
is equal ¦AG¦¦ x ¦BD¦¦, and square ¦Ab¦¦ is equal to ¦Ag¦¦ x ¦bd¦¦, and therefore the
ratio of square ¦AB¦¦ to square ¦Ab¦¦ is compounded of the ratios ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦¦
and ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦¦.
<br><br>

But seeing that ¦GJ¦¦ can be taken to be less than any assigned length
you please, it can be taken to be less than any assigned length you please,

it can happen
<!-- KVK: weak wording; must say in "some neighbourhood of A,
it happens" -->

that the ratio ¦AG¦¦ to ¦Ag¦¦
differ from
the ratio of equality by less
than any assigned difference you please, and therefore, that the 

¦Ab2-AB2¦ratio¦¦ square ¦AB¦¦

to square ¦Ab¦¦ ¦claimRatio¦differ from¦¦ the ¦bd-BD¦ratio¦¦ ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦¦ by less than any assigned diffece you
plase.
<!-- KVK: this shows that in Lemma 1, the word "which" relates to ratios,
not to nominator and denominator of the ratio -->
<br><br>



Therefore, by Lemma 1, the ultimate ratio of square ¦AB¦¦ to square ¦Ab¦¦ is the same as
the ultimate ratio of ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦¦.

<!-- KVK:
Interpretation 1:
BD/bd is an arbitrarily chosen, it does not have ultimate ratio;
the wording "eadem cum" must be not like above, but like:

(BD/bd) / (ABxAB/(AbxAb)) has ulitmate ratio of equality; (*)

secondary, this is a limit of a set: for all chors bd inside of BD, (*) holds

Interpretation 2.
Ratio AD/Ad is fixed. Then lemma is about of limit of function.
( lim (ABxAB/(AbxAb)) ) = BD/bd =const
-->
<br>
Q.E.D.
<br><br><br>


CASE 2. Now let ¦BD¦¦ be inclined to ¦AD¦¦ at any given angle you please, and
the ratio ¦BD¦¦ to ¦bd¦¦ will always the same as before, and therefore will be
the same as square ¦AB¦¦ to ¦Ab¦¦.
<br>
Q.E.D.
<br><br><br>


CASE 3. And even if the angle ¦AD BD¦D¦¦ not be given, but that the straight line
¦BD¦¦ converge toward some given point, or ¦limitRatio¦be established by any other law
whatever¦¦, nevertheless, the angles ¦AD BD¦D¦¦, ¦Ad bd¦d¦¦ being
established by the law in common,
will always converge to equality and will approach nearer to each other
than by any assigned difference
<!-- KVK: again clear epsilon-delta definition of limit/convergence -->

you please, and therefore will ultimately be equal, by Lemma1; and on that account
the lines ¦BD¦¦, ¦bd¦¦ are in the same ratio to each other as before.

COR. 1. Hence, since the tangents ¦AD¦¦, ¦Ad¦¦,


the arcs ¦arc-AB¦AB¦¦, ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦, and their sines, ¦BC¦¦, ¦bc¦¦,
become ultimately equal to the chords ¦AB¦¦, ¦Ab¦¦,
their squares will also be ultimately as the subtenses ¦BD¦¦, ¦bd¦¦.
<br><br><br>

COR. 2. The squares of the same are also ultimately as the sagittae of the arcs which
bisect the chords and converge to a given point. For these sagittae are as the subtenses
BD, bd.
<br><br><br>



COR. 3. Therefore, the sagitta is in the duplicate ratio of the time in which
a given body describes the arc with a given velocity.
<br><br><br>

COR. 4. The rectilinear triangles ADB, Adb are ultimately in the triplicate ratio of the sides AD, Ad,
and in a sesquiplicate ratio of the sides DB, db; as being in the ratio compounded of the sides AD to DB,
and of Ad to db.

So also the triangles ABC, Abe
are ultimately in the triplicate ratio of the sides BC, bc. What I call the sesquiplicate ratio is the subduplicate
of the triplicate, as being compounded of the simple
and subduplicate ratio.
<br><br><br>

COR. 5. And because DB, db are ultimately parallel
and in the duplicate ratio of the lines AD, Ad, the
ultimate curvilinear areas ADB, Adb will be (by the nature of the parabola)
two thirds of the rectilinear triangles ADB, Adb and the segments
AB, Ab will be
one third

<!-- KVK: does not make sense. This makes sense: AD ~ area^(1/3) -->

of the same triangles. And thence those areas and those segments will be in the triplicite ratio as well of the tangents
AD, Ad, as of the chords and arcs AB, AB.
