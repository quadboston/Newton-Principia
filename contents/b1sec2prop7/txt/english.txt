Let ¦orbit¦VQPA¦¦ be the ¦orbit¦circumference of the circle¦¦, ¦S¦¦ the given
point toward which the ¦force¦¦
tends as to its center, ¦P¦P the body¦¦
revolving in the circumference, ¦Q¦Q the place¦¦ to which it will move
next, and ¦PR PZ P,Zminus¦PRZ the tangent¦¦ of
the circle at the ¦P¦previous place¦¦.
Through ¦S¦point S¦¦ draw ¦PV¦chord PV¦¦;
and when the ¦AV¦diameter VA¦¦ of
the circle has been drawn, join
¦AP¦¦; and to ¦SP¦¦ drop perpendicular

¦QT¦¦, which when ¦ZQ¦produced¦¦ meets the ¦PR PZ P,Zminus¦tangent PR¦¦ at ¦Z¦¦;
and finally through
point ¦Q¦¦ draw ¦RL¦LR¦¦ parallel to ¦SP¦¦ and meeting both the circle at ¦L¦¦ and the
tangent ¦PZ¦¦ at ¦R¦¦.<br><br>

Then because the triangles ¦ZQ QR ZR¦ZQR¦¦,
¦ZQ QT PZ PT¦ZTP¦¦, and ¦PV AP AV¦VPA¦¦ are
similar,

¦PR¦RP¦¦² (that is, ¦QR¦¦ x ¦RL¦¦) will be to ¦QT¦QT¦¦² as ¦AV¦AV²¦¦ to ¦PV¦PV²¦¦.

And therefore ¦QR¦¦ x ¦RL¦¦ x ¦PV¦¦² / ¦AV¦¦² is equal to ¦QT¦¦².

Multiply these equals by ¦SP¦¦²/¦QR¦¦ and, the points ¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ coming together, write ¦PV¦¦ for ¦RL¦¦.

Thus ¦SP¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦³ / ¦AV¦¦² will become equal to ¦SP¦¦² x ¦QT¦¦² / ¦QR¦¦.

Therefore (by prop. 6, corols. 1 and 5), the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely as

¦SP¦SP²¦¦ x ¦PV¦PV³¦¦ / ¦AV¦¦², that is (because ¦AV¦¦² is given), inversely as the square of the
distance or altitude ¦SP¦¦ and the cube of the chord jointly. Q.E.I.

<i>Another solution</i>
<br><br>

Draw ¦SY¦¦ perpendicular to the tangent ¦PR¦¦ produced; then, because triangles ¦SY PY SP¦SYP¦¦ and ¦PV AP AV¦VPA¦¦

are similar, ¦AV¦¦ will be to ¦PV¦¦ as ¦SP¦¦ to ¦SY¦¦, and thus
¦SP¦¦ x ¦PV¦¦ / ¦AV¦¦ will be equal to ¦SY¦¦, and
¦SP¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦³ / ¦AV¦¦² will be equal to ¦SY¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦.

And therefore (by prop. 6, corols. 3 and 5), the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ is inversely
as ¦SP¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦³ / ¦AV¦¦², that is, because ¦AV¦¦ is given, inversely as

¦SP¦SP²¦¦ x ¦PV¦PV³¦¦. Q.E.I.

Hence, if the given point ¦S¦¦ to which the ¦force¦centripetal force¦¦
always tends is located in the circumference of this circle, say at ¦V¦¦, the
¦force¦centripetal force¦¦ will be inversely as the fifth power of the altitude ¦SP¦¦.

The ¦force¦force¦¦ by which body
¦P¦¦ revolves in the circle ¦orbit¦APTV¦¦ around the
¦S¦center of forces S¦¦ is to the force by which the
¦P¦same body P¦¦ can revolve in the same circle
and in the same periodic time around any
other center of ¦Rcol2¦forces R¦¦ as
RP² x SP to the cube of the
¦Gcol2,S¦straight line SG¦¦, which is drawn
from the ¦S¦first center of forces S¦¦ to the
¦Gcol2,P¦tangent of the orbit PG¦¦ and is parallel to the ¦Rcol2,P¦distance of the body¦¦ from ¦Rcol2¦the second center of forces¦¦.

For by the construction of this proposition the ¦force¦first force¦¦ is
to the second force as ¦PR¦RP¦¦² x ¦PT¦¦³ to ¦SP¦¦² x ¦PV¦¦³,
that is, as ¦SP¦¦ x ¦PR¦RP¦¦² to ¦SP¦¦³ x ¦PV¦¦³ / ¦PT¦¦³,
or (because the triangles ¦Gcol2,S SP Gcol2,P¦PSG¦¦ and
¦Rcol2,Tcol2 Rcol2,P PV Tcol2,V¦TPV¦¦ are similar) to ¦Gcol2,S¦SG³¦¦.

The ¦force¦force¦¦ by which ¦P¦body P¦¦ revolves in any ¦orbit¦¦ around
the ¦S¦center of forces S¦¦ is to the force by which the same ¦P¦body P¦¦ can revolve
in the same orbit and in the same periodic time around any other
¦Rcol2¦center of forces R¦¦ as the solid ¦SP¦¦ x ¦PR¦RP¦¦² - contained under ¦SP¦the distance of the body¦¦
from the first ¦S¦center of forces S¦¦ and the square of ¦Rcol2,P¦its distance from the second
center of forces R¦¦ - to the cube of the ¦Gcol2,S¦straight line SG¦¦, which is drawn from
the ¦S¦first center of forces S¦¦ to the ¦Gcol2,P¦tangent of the orbit PG¦¦ and is parallel to
the ¦Rcol2,P¦distance RP¦¦ of the body from the second center of forces. For the forces
in this orbit at any ¦P¦point of it P¦¦ are the same as in a circle of the same
curvature.
