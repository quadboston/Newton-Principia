If several bodies revolve about a common center and the centripetal force is in-
versely as the square of the distance of places from the center, I say that the
principal latera recta of the orbits are as the squares of the areas which the bodies
describe in the same time by radii drawn to the center.

For (by prop. 13, corol. 2) the latus rectum L is equal to the quantity QT² / QR
that results ultimately when points P and Q come together. But the minimally
small line QR is in a given time as the generating centripetal force, that is (by
hypothesis), inversely as ¦SP¦SP²¦¦. Therefore, QT² / QR is as
QT² x ¦SP¦SP²¦¦, that is, the latus rectum L is as
the square of the area QT x ¦SP¦¦. Q.E.D.

Hence the total area of the ellipse and, proportional to it,
the rectangle contained by the axes is as the square root of the latus rectum
and as the periodic time. For the total area is as the area QT x SP, which is
described in a given time, multiplied by the periodic time.
