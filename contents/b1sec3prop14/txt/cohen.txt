If several bodies revolve about a ¦S¦common center¦¦ and the centripetal force is in-
versely as the square of ¦SP¦the distance of places¦¦ from ¦S¦the center¦¦, I say that the
¦L,LL¦principal latera recta¦¦ of ¦orbit¦the orbits¦¦ are as the squares of
the ¦instanttriangle¦areas¦¦ which ¦P¦the bodies¦¦
describe in the same time by ¦SP¦radii¦¦ drawn to the ¦S¦center¦¦.

the latus rectum L is equal to the quantity QT² / QR
that results ultimately when points P and Q come together. But the minimally
small line QR is in a given time as the generating centripetal force, that is (by
hypothesis), inversely as ¦SP¦SP²¦¦. Therefore, QT² / QR is as
QT² x ¦SP¦SP²¦¦, that is, the latus rectum L is as
the square of ¦instanttriangle¦the area¦¦ QT x ¦SP¦¦. Q.E.D.
