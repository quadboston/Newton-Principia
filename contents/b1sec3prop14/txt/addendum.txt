Hi John.
Thank you for your thoughts. This is what I came up so far on these props.

Prop. 15. basically does not need a diagram.
Prop. 16. needs two sliders for base law: for speed and perpendicular, and, perhaps for shape changer: e.

Prop. 14:

f = 𝜎 (S˙/r)²/ρ⟂
Given inverse square law for f, "Latus rectum", the constant L=2ρ⟂, is proportional to S˙², between all possible orbits. This is what this proposition means.
https://landkey.net/z/bs/nl9/demo/13810-addk/addendum.prod.html?conf=sappId=b1sec3prop14,logic_phaseId=proof,aspectId=addendum

In diagram, one can have two kind of handles.
1) changing the shape, but preserving the L and see S preserves.
2) changing either the L or S and fixing as much of the other shape parameters which are possible to fix to make the claim clear as possible and see the ratio preserves.

In current implementation, 
the only 2) is implemented: 
a) slider changes excentricity, e, and fixes fi, r, and |𝘃|.
b) slider changes fi and preserves e, r, and |v|. (Only L and ^𝘃,𝗿 do change proportionally.)
c) handle changes v and preserving r (two complex to grasp)

This current demo is focused on generalization of force law f(r). We should focus only on f=a/r^2.
Therefore, less complicated demo shuld ingronre change of conic axes and r and include only e and scale of the conic.

2) fi must be fixed when changing L.
2a already accomplishes this
2c) handle changes v and preserving r and fi
We should not have slider for L because this creates uncertainity, due which paramters of orbit change of L happens.
2) we can add handle for scaling of the cureve for point P along SP.

We should not have handles for Dt because this leads away from the meaning of the theorem.
Or we can make this for Q and have data table for the ratio L/area^2
