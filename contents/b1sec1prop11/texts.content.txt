it is required to find the law of the centripetal
¦force¦¦ tending toward a focus of the ellipse.

Let ¦S¦¦ be a focus of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦. Draw ¦SP¦¦ cutting both the diameter ¦DK¦¦
of the ellipse in ¦E¦¦ and the ordinate ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ in x, and complete the parallelogram
QorPR. It is evident that EP is equal to the semiaxis major AC because when
line HI is drawn parallel to EC from the other focus H of the ellipse, ES
and El are equal because CS and CH are equal; so that EP is the half-sum
of PS and PI, that is (because HI and PR are parallel and angles IPR and
HPZ are equal), the half-sum of PS and PH (which taken together equal
the whole axis 2AC). Drop QT perpendicular to SP, and if L denotes the
/ 2BC2
\
principal latus rectum of the ellipse I or 1, L x QR will be to L x Pv
\ AC /
as QR to Pv, that is, as PE or AC to PC; and L x Pv will be to Gv x vP as


a. For a gloss on this proposition see the Guide, §10.9.


L to Gv, andb
 Gv x vP will be to Qv2
 as PC2
 to CD2
; and (by lem. 7, corol.
2) the ratio of Qv2
 to Q*2
, with the points Q and P coming together, is the
ratio of equality; and Q*2 or Qz/2 is to QT2 as EP2 to PF2, that is, as CA2 to
PF2 or (by lem. 12) as CD2 to CB2. And when all these ratios are combined, L x QR will be to QT2
 as AC x L x PC2
 x CD2
, or as 2CB2
 x PC2
 x CD2
to PC x Gv x CD2
 x CB2
, or as 2PC to Gv. But with the points Q and P
coming together, 2PC and Gv are equal. Therefore, L x QR and QT2
, which
SP2
are proportional to these, are also equal. Multiply these equals by , and
SP2
 x QT2
L x SP2
 will become equal to . Therefore (by prop. 6, corols. 1
QR
and 5) the centripetal force is inversely as L x SP2
, that is, inversely as the
square of the distance SP. Q.E.I.

Let ¦AO¦CA¦¦ and ¦BO¦CB¦¦ be the semiaxes of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦, ¦GP¦¦ and ¦DK¦¦ other conjugate diameters, ¦PF¦¦ and ¦QT¦¦ perpendiculars to those diameters, ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ an ordinate to diameter ¦GP¦¦; then, if parallelogram ¦Qv PR¦Q𝑣PR¦¦ is completed, the rectangle ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ x ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ will (from the Conicsᵃ) be to ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦²

as ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to ¦DO¦CD¦¦², and

(because
triangles ¦Qv QT Tv¦Q𝑣T¦¦ and ¦PO FO PF¦PCF¦¦ are similar)
¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦², and,

when these ratios are combined, the rectangle ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ x ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ is to QT² as ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to
¦DO¦CD¦¦² and ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦²; that is, ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ is
to ¦QT¦¦²/¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ as ¦PO¦PC¦¦² to ¦DO¦CD¦¦² x ¦PF¦¦² / ¦PO¦PC¦¦².

Write
¦QR¦¦ for ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦  and (by lem. 12) ¦BO¦BC¦¦ x ¦AO¦CA¦¦ for ¦DO¦CD¦¦ x ¦PF¦¦, and also (points ¦P¦¦

means together, ¦QT¦¦² x ¦PO¦PC¦¦² / ¦QR¦¦ will become equal to 2¦BO¦BC¦¦² x ¦AO¦CA¦¦² / ¦PO¦PC¦¦. Therefore

(<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1prop6,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary5">by prop. 6, corol. 5</a>), the centripetal ¦force¦¦ is as 2¦BO¦BC¦¦² x ¦AO¦CA¦¦² / ¦PO¦PC¦¦ inversely, that

is (because 2¦BO¦BC¦¦² x ¦AO¦CA¦¦² is given), as 1/¦PO¦PC¦¦ inversely, that is, as the distance ¦PO¦PC¦¦
directly. Q.E.I.

The force which tends toward the center of the ellipse, and by which
body P can revolve in that ellipse, is (by prop. 10, corol. 1) as the distance CP
of the body from the center C of the ellipse; hence, if CE is drawn parallel to
the tangent PR of the ellipse and if CE and PS meet at E, then the force by
which the same body P can revolve around any other point S of the ellipse
PE3
will (by prop. 7, corol. 3) be as —-; that is, if point S is a focus of the ellipse,
ol
and therefore PE is given, this force will be inversely as SP2
. Q.E.I.
This solution could be extended to the parabola and the hyperbola as
concisely as in prop. 10, but because of the importance of this problem and
its use in what follows, it will not be too troublesome to confirm each of
these other cases by a separate demonstration

On the straight line ¦GP¦PG¦¦ take a point ¦u¦𝑢¦¦ on the other side of point ¦T¦¦,
so that ¦Tu¦T𝑢¦¦ is equal to ¦Tv¦T𝑣¦¦; then take ¦u,VV¦𝑢V¦¦ such that it is to ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ as
¦DO¦DC¦¦² is to
¦PO¦PC¦¦². And since (from the Conics) ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ x ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ as
¦DO¦DC¦¦² to ¦PO¦PC¦¦², ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦²
will be equal to ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ X ¦u,VV¦𝑢V¦¦. Add the rectangle ¦uP¦𝑢P¦¦ x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ to both sides, and the

square of the chord of arc ¦PQ¦¦ will come out equal to the rectangle ¦P,VV¦VP¦¦ x ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦;
and therefore ¦tangentCircle¦a circle¦¦ that touches
the conic section at ¦P¦¦ and passes through
point ¦Q¦¦ will also pass through point ¦VV¦V¦¦. Let points ¦P¦¦ and ¦Q¦¦ come together,
and the ratio of ¦u,VV¦𝑢V¦¦ to ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦, which is the same as the ratio of ¦DO¦DC¦¦² to ¦PO¦PC¦¦²,

will become the ratio of ¦P,VV¦PV¦¦ to ¦GP¦PG¦¦ or ¦P,VV¦PV¦¦ to 2¦PO¦PC¦¦;
and therefore ¦P,VV¦PV¦¦ will
be equal to 2¦DO¦DC¦¦²/¦PO¦PC¦¦. Accordingly, the ¦force¦¦ under the action of which body ¦P¦¦
revolves in the ellipse will (<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1prop6,theorionId=corollary,aspectId=english,subessayId=corollary3">by prop. 6, corol. 3</a>) be as 2¦DO¦DC¦¦² / ¦PO¦PC¦¦ x ¦PF¦¦² inversely,
that is (because 2¦DO¦DC¦¦² x ¦PF¦¦² is given), as ¦PO¦PC¦¦ directly. Q.E.I.
