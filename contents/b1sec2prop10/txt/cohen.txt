¦PF¦¦ and ¦QT¦¦ perpendiculars to those diameters, ¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦ an ordinate to diameter ¦GP¦¦;

(because

¦Qv¦Q𝑣¦¦² is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦PC¦¦² to ¦PF¦¦², and,
when these ratios are combined, the rectangle ¦Pv¦P𝑣¦¦ × ¦vG¦𝑣G¦¦ is to ¦QT¦¦² as ¦PC¦¦² to

On the straight line ¦GP¦PG¦¦ take a point ¦u¦𝑢¦¦ on the other side of point ¦T¦¦,

Therefore, the ¦force¦¦ is as ¦PC¦the distance¦¦ of ¦P¦the body¦¦ from
¦C¦the center¦¦ of the ¦orbit¦ellipse¦¦; and, conversely,
if the ¦force¦¦ is as the ¦PC¦distance¦¦, the
body will move in an ellipse having ¦C¦its center¦¦ in the center of ¦force¦forces¦¦, or
perhaps it will move in a circle, into which an ellipse can be changed.

And the periodic times of the revolutions made in all ellipses universally around the same center will be equal. For in similar ellipses
those times are equal (by prop. 4, corols. 3 and 8), while in ellipses having a
common ¦A,AA¦major axis¦¦ they are to one another as the total areas of the ellipses
directly and the particles of the areas described in the same time inversely;
that is, as the ¦B,BB¦minor axes¦¦ directly and the velocities of bodies in their principal 
vertices inversely; that is, as those ¦B,BB¦minor axes¦¦ directly and the ordinates
to the same point of the common axis inversely; and therefore (because of
the equality of the direct and inverse ratios) in the ratio of equality.

If the ¦C¦center¦¦ of the ellipse goes off to infinity, so that the ellipse turns into
a parabola, the body will move in this parabola, and the ¦force¦¦, now tending
toward an infinitely distant ¦C¦center¦¦, will prove to be uniform. This is Galileo's
theorem. And if (by changing the inclination of the cutting plane to the
cone) the parabolic section of the cone turns into a hyperbola, the body will
move in the perimeter of the hyperbola, with the centripetal ¦force¦¦ turned
into a centrifugal ¦force¦¦. And just as in a circle or an ellipse, if the ¦force¦forces¦¦
tend toward a figure's ¦C¦center¦¦ located in the abscissa, and if the ordinates are
increased or decreased in any given ratio or even if the angle of the inclination
of the ordinates to the abscissa is changed, these ¦force¦forces¦¦ are always increased
or decreased in the ratio of the ¦PC¦distances¦¦ from the ¦C¦center¦¦, provided that the
periodic times remain equal; so also in all figures universally, if the ordinates
are increased or decreased in any given ratio or the angle of inclination of
the ordinates is changed in any way while the periodic time remains the
same, the ¦force¦forces¦¦ tending toward any ¦C¦center¦¦ located in the abscissa are, for
each individual ordinate, increased or decreased in the ratio of the distances
from the ¦C¦center¦¦.
