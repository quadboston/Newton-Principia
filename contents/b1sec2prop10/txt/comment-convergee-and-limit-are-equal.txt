This would be misleading:
    f_actual / f_actual_max
    f_estimated / f_actual_max
In P10 this will make an illusion, that process dQ->0 displays convergency of estimated value to limit value. But there is no convergency, but is an exact equality. Equality of a shape of convergee function and shape of ultimate function.

And if to look deeper, f_actual_max is never known to Newton and never known in the Book, and in general is meanngless. All "magnitudes" of force "10 newtons", "100 kilograms", are always a ratios to "ethalone force".

What f_actual_max is in the Book, and in our program is a limit of ratio
f_estimated / f_estimated_at_some_point

Replacing f_estimated_at_some_point (we do use f_estimated_max for that) with f_actual_max is not how conversion process is done, because to find f_actual_max we find first "f_estimated / f_estimated_at_some_point" during conversion process and then take maximum of that ultimate ratio as
f_actual_max

(One more time is interesting, f_actual_max is not an actual value of force, but still a ratio. In Physics we never know "actual values" and don't need to know.)

***

A)
f_actual / f_actual_max
f_estimated / f_actual_max

Then you changed it back to draw

B)
f_actual / f_actual_max and
f_estimated / f_estimated_max.

I never had it like A. 

--What I have change, I did migrate from convergency by ∆t to convergency by ∆q. This removed time grid to speed up calculations. When one "converge" by ∆t, there likely will be different shapes.

PS: the fact when convergee and unltimate are eual, was quite surprising and quite rare, I first thought there is a bug in my program and as a dummy person was searching for the bug.


I think this is atificial. We have two finctions g=f_est/f_est_max
g'=f_ultimate/f_ulitmate_max which alreade equal g'=g.


Now we do "corrupt" converging proces g->g' by artivicially changing g to make a false illusion of existance of convergence which does not exist because what does exist is an exac equality g=g'.


Moreover, the ratio f_ultimate(r)/f_ulitmate(r_max) is a ration of two real magnitudes at points r and r_max.
The ratio f_est(r)/f_est(r_max) has simialr meaning.
The ratio f_est(r)/f_ultimate(r_max) has less Physical meaning.


Functions
f_est
and
f_ultimate,

have no meaning. They are not forces and don't represent an object in material world. f_ultimate/f_ultimate_at_some_point represents the force per unit f_ultimate_at_some_point.

f_est/f_ultimate_max is a clever trick which illustrates how our selected computing model works. Because they are related by computing procedure.
