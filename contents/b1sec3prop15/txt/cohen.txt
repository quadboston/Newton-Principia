Under the same suppositions as in prop. 14, I say that the squares of the periodic
times in ellipses are as the cubes of the ¦A,AA¦major axes¦¦.

For the ¦B,BB¦minor axis¦¦ is a mean proportional between the ¦A,AA¦major axis¦¦ and the
¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦, and thus the rectangle contained by the axes is as the square
root of the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ and as the
 3/2 power of the ¦A,AA¦major axis¦¦. But this
rectangle (by prop. 14, corol.) is as the square root of the ¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦ and
as the periodic time. Take away from both sides [i.e., divide through by] the
square root of the latus rectum, and the result will be that the squares of the
periodic times are as the cubes of the ¦A,AA¦major axes¦¦. Q.E.D.
