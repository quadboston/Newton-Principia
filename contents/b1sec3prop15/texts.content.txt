Under the same suppositions as in prop. 14, I say that the squares of the periodic
Theorem 7 times in ellipses are as the cubes of the major axes.

For the minor axis is a mean proportional between the major axis and the
latus rectum, and thus the rectangle contained by the axes is as the square
root of the latus rectum and as the
 3/2 power of the major axis. But this
rectangle (by prop. 14, corol.) is as the square root of the latus rectum and
as the periodic time. Take away from both sides [i.e., divide through by] the
square root of the latus rectum, and the result will be that the squares of the
periodic times are as the cubes of the major axes. Q.E.D.

Therefore the periodic times in ellipses are the same as in
circles whose diameters are equal to the major axes of the ellipses
