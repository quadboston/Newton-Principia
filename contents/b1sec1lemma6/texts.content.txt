If any arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, given in position, is subtended by its chord ¦AB¦AB¦¦,
and in any point
¦A¦A¦¦, in the middle of the continued curvature, is touched by a ¦AD¦right line AD¦¦, produced both ways; then if the points ¦A¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦B¦¦

 <span class="captured-reference id-true-convergence-1">approach one another</span>

 <span class="captured-reference id-meet">and meet</span>,

I say, ¦AB AD *anch-color*given¦the angle BAD¦¦, contained between,
the chord and the tangent, will be diminished in infinitum, and ultimately will vanish.

    For if that angle does not vanish, 

    the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ will contain with the

    tangent ¦AD¦AD¦¦ an angle equal to a ¦AL Ad¦rectilinear angle¦¦; and
    therefore the curvature at the point ¦A¦A¦¦ will not be continued,
    which is against the supposition.

We call right-side line ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ "Euclidian-tangent".<br>
Line ¦AL¦AL¦¦, which will be is a limit of chords, is called "Converged-tangent".<br><br>

<b>Euclid and Newton axioms, definitions, and assumptions for Euclidian-tangent are:<br><br></b>

<ol>
<li>
    definition: tangent has only one point with the curve
</li>
<li>
   assumption: when curve's curvature at point ¦A¦A¦¦ is continuous, then
   there is no non-zero rightlinear angle between tangent and and the curve.
   <br><br>

   Requirement "continuous curvature"
   ( in modern sense, as a derivative of tangent direction )
   is excessive for the purpose of lemma, and should instead mean
   "continous tangnent direction" and probably
   means this in the original text
   <br><br>

   This assumption is proven for circle (EI.16) and may be proven for conics by using this
   schema: <br><br>
   for projection of circle into conic cut:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>rightline goes to rightline,</li>
        <li>line crosses point goes to line crosses,</li>
        <li>sequence of points on lines is preserved,</li>
        <li>betweenness is preserved,</li>
        <li>which completes the proof,</li>
    </ul><br><br>

   We don't know is this assumption proven for non-conics in the Book, and it may be
   considered as a starting axiom, depending on chosen Geometry framwork.

</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<b>Newton axioms, definitions, and assumptions for "Converged-tangent" are:</b>
<br><br>

<ol>
<li>
   Assumption: <br>
   chords do converge <br>
   (at least for curves considered in the Book)
</li>


<li>
   lemma is itself a Converged-tangent definition ( or construction of such ),
   and is informal attempt to prove it is equal to Euclidian-tangent. <br><br>

   For "monotonic chords", (monotonic sequence of points b for
   some neighbourhood of point A) existence of
   ¦L¦limit L¦¦ is equivalent to Dedekind/Cantor continuity axiom for Geometry.
</li>
<br><br>


<b>In other words, the lemma claims that
<span class="captured-reference id-L-equal-d"> ¦L¦L¦¦ = ¦d¦d¦¦ </span>.</b>

This essay attmepts to reconstruct logical steps of Newton's proof. This attempt does not look successful unless to assume the case of convex curve or curve with monotonic sequence of points "¦b¦¦" approaching their upper bound ¦L¦¦.<br><br>

<b>"Proof"</b><br><br>

  Take an arbitrary point ¦d¦d¦¦ that ¦D¦D¦¦ is between ¦d¦d¦¦ and ¦A¦A¦¦.
  Draw the line ¦rd¦line rd¦¦ through an arbitrary point ¦r¦r¦¦
  that both ¦B¦B¦¦ and ¦r¦r¦¦ are on the same side of ¦AD¦line AD¦¦.

  Let point ¦b¦b¦¦ be an intersection of lines ¦AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦rd¦rd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  Draw arc ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦ proportionally to ¦arc-AB¦arc AB¦¦ with ratio ¦Ab¦Ab¦¦/¦AB¦AB¦¦.
  <br><br>
 
  <span class="captured-reference id-reset-to-origin">Suppose</span>

  when points ¦B¦B¦¦ move closer to point ¦A¦A¦¦,
  the points ¦b¦b¦¦ have upper bound
  ¦L¦L¦¦ on ¦rd¦line rd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  But when point ¦B¦B¦¦ moves

    <span class="captured-reference id-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦A¦A¦¦, the ¦arc-Ab¦arc Ab¦¦ becomes (flatten and)

    <span class="captured-reference id-more-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦Ab¦Ab¦¦ and ultimately cannot lie above any line above ¦AL¦AL¦¦.
    <br>
    This is actually an assumption based on intuition and cannot be considered as a rigid proof.
    <br><br>

    Therefore any rectilinear angle alpha between ¦AL¦AL¦¦ and
    ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ lies above curves ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦.
    ¦arc-AB¦Arc AB¦¦ lies below ¦arc-Ab¦arcs Ab¦¦
    and below ¦AL¦¦ which contradicts the supposition.
