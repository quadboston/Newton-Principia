If any arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, given in position, is subtended by its chord ¦AB¦AB¦¦,
and in any point
¦A¦A¦¦, in the middle of the continued curvature, is touched by a ¦AD¦right line AD¦¦, produced both ways; then if the points ¦A¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦B¦¦

 <span class="captured-reference id-true-convergence-1">approach one another</span>

I say, ¦angleBAD AB AD *anch-color*given¦the angle BAD¦¦, contained between,
the chord and the tangent, will be diminished in infinitum, and ultimately will vanish.

    the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ will contain with the

<b>Draft beginning.</b>
<br><br>
A supposition of lemma 6 is that curve has continuous curvature. This can mean two different things.
<br><br>
1. Curve has no "corner". In other words, 

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=euclid-framework-curves#onc-side-euclidean-tangent">
left and right Eucledian tangets are on the same line.
</a>
 
However, lemma 6 is

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=continuous-if-curve#cif-breaks-l6">incorrect in this case.</a>

Even when curve is continous.
<br><br>

2. Second meaning can be that curve has left and right curvature and both curvatures are equal by value and center. In this case Lemma 6 is also incorrect. It becomes correct, however, if to add  either one of the following suppositions: either a) curve is continuous at point A, or b) curve has a length
in neighbourhood of A.
<br><br>

But if to take the supposition a) or b), the lemma 6 becomes a logical redundancy. Because in 
process of proving existance of curvature, the conclusion of lemma 6 becomes already proven.
<br><br>


3. What can be the most natural choice of Lemma 6 suppositions? Because of final conclusion is that chord's angle has limit zero, then chord's angle has a limit. Taken a latter one gives minimal supposition set:
<br><br>

(i) curve has one-side Euclidean tangent,
<br>
(ii) this-side chords angle has a limit when chord's length approaches 0.
<br><br>

Then Lemma 6 can be formulated as:<br>

    <div style="text-align:center">
        (i) and (ii) ⇒ (j)
    </div>

where (j) means:
<br>
(j) angle between Euclidean tangent and chord is ultimately 0.
<br><br><br>


4. Apparently real point of lemma 6 is actually not the proof of that E-tangent and differential tangent are equal. Lemma 6 subposition (ii) constructs conceptually different definition of the tangent: differential tangent, tangent as a limiting position of decreasing chords.
<br><br>

(ii) automatically extends definition of tangent to non-Euclidean tangents, for example for
non-convex functions in neighbouhood of point A, like x²sin(1/x) at A=(0,0). 
<br><br>

Moreover, in CalculusXX, this definition becomes logical backbone of the Calculus instead of Euclidean tangent.

<br><br>

<b>Claim.</b> (i)&(ii) → (j).
<br><br>
<b>Proof 1</b><br><br>

  This is not a general proof. This is a proof for convex curve, with monotonic sequence of points "¦b¦¦" approaching their upper bound ¦L¦¦.<br><br>

  Take an arbitrary point ¦d¦d¦¦ that ¦D¦D¦¦ is between ¦d¦d¦¦ and ¦A¦A¦¦.
  Draw the line ¦rd¦line rd¦¦ through an arbitrary point ¦r¦r¦¦
  that both ¦B¦B¦¦ and ¦r¦r¦¦ are on the same side of ¦AD¦line AD¦¦.

  Let point ¦b¦b¦¦ be an intersection of lines ¦AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦rd¦rd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  Draw arc ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦ proportionally to ¦arc-AB¦arc AB¦¦ with ratio ¦Ab¦Ab¦¦/¦AB¦AB¦¦.
  <br><br>
 
  <span class="captured-reference id-reset-to-origin">Suppose</span>

  when points ¦B¦B¦¦ move closer to point ¦A¦A¦¦,
  the points ¦b¦b¦¦ have upper bound
  ¦L¦L¦¦ on ¦rd¦line rd¦¦ (which is equivalent to Dedekind/Cantor continuity axiom for Geometry.)
  <br><br>

  But when point ¦B¦B¦¦ moves

    <span class="captured-reference id-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦A¦A¦¦, ( the ¦arc-Ab¦arc Ab¦¦ becomes (flatten and)

    <span class="captured-reference id-more-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦Ab¦Ab¦¦ and ultimately cannot lie above any line above ¦AL¦AL¦¦. )
    <br>
    <br><br>

    Therefore any rectilinear angle alpha between ¦AL¦AL¦¦ and
    ¦Ad¦Ad¦¦ lies above curves ¦arc-Ab¦Ab¦¦.
    ¦arc-AB¦Arc AB¦¦ lies below ¦arc-Ab¦arcs Ab¦¦
    and below ¦AL¦¦ which contradicts the supposition.
