and in any point
¦A¦A¦¦, in the middle of the continued curvature, is touched by a ¦line-AD¦right line AD¦¦, produced both ways; then if the points ¦A¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦B¦¦

    For if that angle does not vanish, 

    the arc ¦curve-AB¦ACB¦¦ will contain with the

    tangent ¦line-AD¦AD¦¦ an angle equal to a ¦line-AL line-Ad¦rectilinear angle¦¦; and
    therefore the curvature at the point ¦A¦A¦¦ will not be continued,
    which is against the supposition.

We call right-side line ¦line-Ad¦Ad¦¦ "Euclidian-tangent".<br>
Line ¦line-AL¦AL¦¦, which will be is a limit of chords, is called "Converged-tangent".<br><br>

<b>Euclid and Newton axioms, definitions, and assumptions for Euclidian-tangent are:<br><br></b>

<ol>
<li>
    definition: tangent has only one point with the curve
</li>
<li>
   assumption: when curve's curvature at point ¦A¦A¦¦ is continuous, then
   there is no non-zero rightlinear angle between tangent and and the curve.
   <br><br>

   Requirement "continuous curvature"
   ( in modern sense, as a derivative of tangent direction )
   is excessive for the purpose of lemma, and should instead mean
   "continous tangnent direction" and probably
   means this in the original text
   <br><br>

   This assumption is proven for circle (EI.16) and may be proven for conics by using this
   schema: <br><br>
   for projection of circle into conic cut:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>rightline goes to rightline,</li>
        <li>line crosses point goes to line crosses,</li>
        <li>sequence of points on lines is preserved,</li>
        <li>betweenness is preserved,</li>
        <li>which completes the proof,</li>
    </ul><br><br>

   We don't know is this assumption proven for non-conics in the Book, and it may be
   considered as a starting axiom, depending on chosen Geometry framwork.

</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

<b>Newton axioms, definitions, and assumptions for "Converged-tangent" are:</b>
<br><br>

<ol>
<li>
   Assumption: <br>
   chords do converge <br>
   (at least for curves considered in the Book)
</li>


<li>
   lemma is itself a Converged-tangent definition ( or construction of such ),
   and is informal attempt to prove it is equal to Euclidian-tangent. <br><br>

   For "monotonic chords", (monotonic sequence of points b for
   some neighbourhood of point A) existence of
   ¦L¦limit L¦¦ is equivalent to Dedekind/Cantor continuity axiom for Geometry.
</li>
<br><br>


<b>In other words, the lemma claims that
<span class="captured-reference id-L-equal-d"> ¦L¦L¦¦ = ¦d¦d¦¦ </span>.</b>

This model follows Newton's proof with more details. Pattern of proof is "ad absurdum".<br><br>

<b>"Proof"</b><br><br>

  Take an arbitrary point ¦d¦d¦¦ that ¦D¦D¦¦ is between ¦d¦d¦¦ and ¦A¦A¦¦.
  Draw the line ¦line-rd¦line rd¦¦ through an arbitrary point ¦r¦r¦¦
  that both ¦B¦B¦¦ and ¦r¦r¦¦ are on the same side of ¦line-AD¦line AD¦¦.

  Let point ¦b¦b¦¦ be an intersection of lines ¦line-AB¦AB¦¦ and ¦line-rd¦rd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  Draw curve ¦curve-Ab¦Ab¦¦ that ¦both-curves *anch-color¦curves AB and Ab¦¦ are proportional with ratio ¦line-AB¦AB¦¦/¦line-Ab¦Ab¦¦.
  <br><br>
 
  <span class="captured-reference id-reset-to-origin">Suppose</span>

  when points ¦B¦B¦¦ move closer to point ¦A¦A¦¦,
  the points ¦b¦b¦¦ have upper bound
  ¦L¦L¦¦ on ¦line-rd¦line rd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  But when point ¦B¦B¦¦ moves

    <span class="captured-reference id-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦A¦A¦¦, the ¦curve-Ab¦curve Ab¦¦ becomes (flatten and)

    <span class="captured-reference id-more-closer">closer</span>

    to ¦line-Ab¦Ab¦¦ and ultimately cannot lie above any line above ¦line-AL¦AL¦¦.
    <br>
    This is actually an assumption based on intuition and cannot be considered as a rigid proof.
    <br><br>

    Therefore any rectilinear angle between ¦line-AL¦AL¦¦ and
    ¦line-Ad¦Ad¦¦ lies above curves ¦curve-Ab¦Ab¦¦.
    ¦curve-AB¦Curve AB¦¦ lies below ¦curve-Ab¦curves Ab¦¦
    which is against the supposition.
    <br><br>
