If any arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, given in position, 
is subtended by the chord ¦AB¦¦ 
and at some point ¦A¦¦, 
in the middle of the continuous
curvature, is touched by the straight line ¦AD¦¦, 
produced in both directions,
and if then points ¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦¦ 

 <span class="captured-reference id-true-convergence-1">approach each other</span>

 <span class="captured-reference id-meet">and come together</span>,

I say
that the angle ¦angleBAD AB AD *anch-color*given¦BAD¦¦ contained by the
¦AB¦chord¦¦ and the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ will be indefinitely diminished and will ultimately
vanish.

    For if that ¦angleBAD AB AD *anch-color*given¦angle¦¦ does not vanish, 
    the angle contained by the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ 
    and the tangent ¦AD¦¦ will be equal to a ¦AL Ad L¦rectilinear angle¦¦, 
    and therefore the curvature at point ¦A¦¦ will not be continuous,
    contrary to the hypothesis.
