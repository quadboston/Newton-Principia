If any arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦, given in position, 
is subtended by the chord ¦AB¦¦
and at some point ¦A¦¦, 
in the middle of the continuous
curvature, is touched by the straight line ¦AD¦¦, 
produced in both directions,
and if then points ¦A¦¦ and ¦B¦¦

 <span class="captured-reference id-true-convergence-1">approach
each other</span>

 <span class="captured-reference id-meet">and come together</span>,

I say
that the angle ¦angleBAD AB AD *anch-color*given¦BAD¦¦ contained by the
chord and the tangent will be indefinitely diminished and will ultimately
vanish.

    For if ¦angleBAD AB AD *anch-color*given¦that angle¦¦ does not vanish, 
    the angle contained by the arc ¦arc-AB¦ACB¦¦ 
    and the tangent ¦AD¦¦ will be equal to a ¦AL Ad L¦rectilinear angle¦¦, 
    and therefore the curvature at point ¦A¦¦ will not be continuous,
    <span class="captured-reference id-L-equal-d">contrary to the hypothesis</span>.
