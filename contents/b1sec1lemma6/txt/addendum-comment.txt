A supposition of lemma 6 is that curve has continuous curvature. This can mean two different things.
<br><br>
1. Curve has no "corner". In other words, 

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=euclid-framework-curves#onc-side-euclidean-tangent">
left and right Euclidean tangents are on the same line.
</a>
 
However, lemma 6 is

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=continuous-if-curve#cif-breaks-l6">incorrect in this case.</a>

Even when curve is continous.
<br><br>

2. Second meaning can be that curve has continuous

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=circle-based-curvature#circlescribed-curvature-anchor">CircleScribed curvature</a>.

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=infinite-frequency-circle-based-curvature#if-circlescribed-curve">
In this case Lemma 6 is also incorrect.
</a>

It becomes correct, however, if to add  either one of the following suppositions: either a) curve is continuous at point A, or b) curve has a length
in neighbourhood of A, or c) curve is convex in some neighbourhood of A
<br><br>

But if to take the supposition a) or b), the lemma 6 becomes a logical redundancy. Because in 
process of proving existence of curvature, the conclusion of lemma 6 becomes already proven.
And if to take supposition c) "Convex version", this narrows the set of curves "too much".
<br><br>


Moreover, lemma 6 has no proof text in the Book. The only logical link in proof text is: "suppose angle is not ultimately zero" -&gt; "there is a rectilinear angle gap between curve and Eucledian tangent". This is not Euclidean style logical proof.
<br><br>






3. What can be the most natural choice of Lemma 6 suppositions? Because of final conclusion is that chord's angle has limit zero, then chord's angle has a limit. This conclusion of lemma 6 can be taken as lemma 6 supposition:
<br><br>

(i) curve has one-side Euclidean tangent,
<br>
(ii) one-side chords angle has a limit when chord's length approaches 0.
<br>
We call the ray of limit angle a differential tangnet.
<br><br>

Then Lemma 6 can be formulated as:<br>

    <div style="text-align:center">
        (i) and (ii) ⇒ (j)
    </div>

where (j) means:
<br>
(j) angle between Euclidean tangent and chord is ultimately 0.
<br><br><br>


But in this case, formulation of lemma is still redundant: (i) does follow from (ii) for curves
on one side to limiting angle.

Then Lemma 6 can be formulated in "Differential version":<br>
<br><br>

If
    <div style="text-align:center">
        (ii) differential tangent exists
    </div>
then
    <br><br>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
        <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; width:200px;">
            (a) <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
                for one-side curves (in respect to to diff. tangent )<br>
                =&gt;<br>
                (i)(j) differential and one-side-Euclidean tangents are equal
            </div><br><br>
            (b) othewise,<br>
                =&gt;<br>
                <div style="text-align:left; display:inline-block;">
                    no one-side-Euclidean tangent exist
                </div>
        </div>
    </div>

<b>I. Newtons logic in Lemma 11,</b>
<br>
strongly suggests that by word "curvatue", Newton means
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=circle-based-curvature#circlescribed-curvature-anchor">
"CirlescribedCurvature"

<br><br>

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma11,theorionId=proof,aspectId=english">
Drag point B to A and see that point G has limit J.
</a>

That's a diameter of curvature. It is irrelevant what limit to use
R → R<sub>c</sub> or 2R=D → D<sub>c</sub>=J.
(Rigorously, R and D are vectors from point A to point R or G on diagram, and curvature-radius-vector is a vector AJ which is a limit of these vectors).
<br><br>

(CircleSribed curvature is not the curvature χ in CalculusXX where it is |d²<b>r</b>/ds²|.
Yes, when χ exists, then CircleSribed curvature does exist too and = χ = 1/R<sub>c</sub>, but not other way around:

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=infinite-frequency-circle-based-curvature#if-circlescribed-curve">
for this curve
</a>
CircleSribed curvature does exist, but χ does not because
even the first derivative d<b>r</b>/dt does not exist.
)
<br><br>

<a name="three-lemma6-versions"></a>
<b>II. In addendums, there are offered 3 variants of L6:</b>
<br><br>

<b>Variant 1. Differential.</b> All of these three "Differential" versions are equivalent:
<br>

a) curve is differentiable
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#differential-version">
b) differential tangents exist
</a>
<br>

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#differential-version">
c) chord angle has a limit
</a>
<br><br><br>



<b>Variant 2.<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#pure-convex-version">
Lemma 6. Pure convex version.
</a></b> Apparently chosen in Dana Densmore book.
However, this does not need any premise of "continuity" and "curvature".
<br><br>



<b>Variant 3. Lemma 6. Continues CircleScribe curvature for curve with existing length.</b>
(Did not recorded yet in Addendums.)
<br><br>

Length axioms make
curve continuous at point A which becomes sufficient condition to prove the lemma.
<br><br>

This is what most likely Newton meant. However, this makes "ad absudum" proof in Book's Lemma 6 logically redundant which, perhaps, Newton did not consider significant to pay attention to.
<br><br><br>
 



<b> III. "Differential version" turns calculus logic flow upside down.</b>
<br><br>

In Equclid framework the logic is
<br><br>

... conics, prexisting curves, curve length existence and its properties are apparently assumed,
Euclidean tangents
<br>
 →
<br>
differential tangent definition and its equality to Euclidean
<br><br>

New theory logic is:
<br><br>

differential tangent definition
<br>
 →
curve length s, is built upon on differential tangent definition as
integral of ds = sqrt( dx'² + dy'² ),
<br>
→
<br>
curvature defined from d²r/ds²
<br><br>

Euclidean tangents become irrelevant,
set of curves available for new theory is expanded,
<br><br><br>


<b> IV. Apparently real point of lemma 6 </b> 
<br><br>
is actually not the proof of that E-tangent and differential tangent are equal.
Premise of existance of differential tangent constructs conceptually different definition of the tangent: differential tangent, tangent as a limiting position of decreasing chords.
<br><br>

(ii) automatically extends definition of tangent to non-Euclidean tangents, for example for
non-convex functions in neighbouhood of point A, like x²sin(1/x) at A=(0,0). 
<br><br>

Moreover, in CalculusXX, differential tangent becomes logical backbone of the Calculus instead of Euclidean tangent.

<b>In <a href="&#63;conf=sappId=addd-fw#Eframework">Euclid-framework</a></b><br><br>

<br><br>

For definiteness, consider an arbitrary ray ¦AD¦¦ beginning at point ¦A¦¦ and
¦curve-AB¦ACB¦¦, branch of curve which begins at point ¦A¦¦.<br><br>

<br><br>


<a name="differential-version"></a>
<b>Lemma 6. Differential version. Claim.</b>
<br><br>

If
<br><br>

(ii) ¦AB AD angleBAD¦chords angle BAD¦¦ has a limit ¦AL L AD¦LAD¦¦ when chord's length approaches 0.
<br><br>

then

<br><br>
(i') for ¦curve-AB¦ACB¦¦ which lies on one side of ray ¦AL¦¦ in some of neighborhood of point ¦A¦¦ except point ¦A¦¦, <br><br>
¦AL¦¦ is

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=euclid-framework-curves#onc-side-euclidean-tangent">
one-side Euclidean tangent,
</a>

and angle between this tangent and chord is ultimately 0.
<br><br>
if( (i')  does not hold, then ¦curve-AB¦ACB¦¦ does not have Eclidean tangent at ¦A¦¦.
<br><br><br>


<b>Lemma 6. Differential version. Proof.</b>
<br><br>



Suppose (i') does hold.
Take a ray AX on the same side as a curve that lines AX and ¦AL¦¦ are different. At some distance from A, the chord will be closer to ¦AL¦¦ than angle XAL, hence ¦AL¦¦ is Euclidean tangent.
Suppose (i') does not hold and AE is a Euclidean tangent. Line AE cannot coinside with line
AL because curve is not one side of AL. Take a ray AX with the angle XAE = 1/2 angle EAL.
At some distance, all chords will lie around AL closer than XAE, hence ray AX will lie between
curve and AE which contradicts the supposition.
<br><br><br>




<b>Lemma 6. Convex version.</b>
<br><br>

If curve has one-side-Euclidean tangent and is convex on this side, then with this tangent,
chords angle is ultimately 0.
<br><br>(Note: one can weaken this claim replacing clause "has one-side-Euclidean tangent" with
"one-side-CircleScribed" curvature which implies replaced clause anyway.)
<br><br>

<b>Proof</b>
  For any line AX on the side of Euclidean tangent, there exist curve's chord AE between AX and AD, and since the curve AE will lie above chord AE (by definition of convexivity), all chords of AE will lie between AX and AD. [].
<br><br><br>


<a name="pure-convex-version"></a>
<b>Lemma 6. Pure convex version.</b>
<br><br>

Claim. Convex curve has one-side differential and Euclidean tangents and they are equal.
We assume Dedekind-Cantor continuity axiom. We don't make any assumptions beyound Euclidean Geometry axisoms.
<br><br><br>

  Draw line ¦AD¦¦ that the some A-neighbourhood of curve is on one side from ¦AD¦¦.
  <br><br>
  Take an arbitrary chord ¦AB¦¦ in this neighbourhood an arbitrary point ¦b¦¦ that
  ¦B¦¦ is between A and b and point ¦d¦¦ on the same side from ¦AB¦¦ as ¦curve-AB¦arc AB¦¦
  <br><br>
  Draw the line ¦rd¦line bd¦¦.
  <br><br>

  When point ¦B¦B¦¦ moves closer to point ¦A¦A¦¦, draw the line AB till intersection with db.
  <br><br>
  Point d is an upper bound for points b.
  <br><br>

  The points ¦b¦b¦¦ monotonically move towards point d.
  Therefore according continuity axiom, they have exact upper bound ¦L¦¦.
  The curve lies below ¦AL¦¦.  
  <br>
  Chords angle to ¦AL¦¦ is ultimately 0, hence
  <br>
  ¦AL¦¦ is a differential tangent and is also a Euclidean tangent, (as already proven in
  "Lemma 6. Differential version").
