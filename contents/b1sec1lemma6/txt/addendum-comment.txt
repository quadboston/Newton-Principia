Curve L. "Continuous curvature". This means a

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,logic_phaseId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=circle-based-curvature">"circumscribed curvature"</a>. 

Assume, this means left and right circumscribed curvature radiuses are the same and left and rigth tangents to left and right curvature circles belong to the same line.<br><br>

Because, there is a tangent to the curve exist in both directinos, one can tend to assume that above line is this tangent also.<br><br>

Removing redundant suppositions, one can rewrite the claim as follows:<br><br>

When the a) right curvature exists and b) right tangent to the curve exists, then the angele between the right chord and this tangent is ultimately zero.<br><br>

But we still need to give a definition of the one side tangent to the curve. If for a moment, we give a modern definition as an ultimate position of the chorde, then lemma 6 loses the value, because the claim of the lemma follows from this defintion. More probably, Newton's "tangent definition" will be more like a definition of a tangent to the circle:<br><br>

One side tangent T is<br><br>
1) the line ray L which in some neighbourhood of the curve point A has it's tip A and has no other intersection with the curve.<br>
2) and is "minimally close to the curve", i.e. there is no other ray from A wich lies between L and C and has no other crossigns with C in some neighbourhood of A.<br><br>

This definition implies that the curve C lies to the one side of the tangent in some neighbourhood of the A.<br><br>

In modern sense, this defines very restricted class of tangents and impractical for modern Physics.<br><br>

Note, that without requirement (a), claim fails, for example, for<br><br>
    y = sin(1/x), or        <br>
    y = 1+sqrt(x)sin(|1/x|),    <br><br>
at A = 0 and tangent (x=0, y>=0).

and <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,logic_phaseId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=continuous-if-curve">continuous example</a>.<br><br>

Because in modern calculus language, there is no derivative, "differential tangent". But perhaps, recalling and adding (a) existence of "circumscribed curvature", one "fixes" the claim?<br><br>

No. There can be "circumscribed curvature" in some neighbourhood of point A and in point A itself, but "differential tangent" <a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,logic_phaseId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=infinite-frequency-circle-based-curvature#if-circlescribed-curve">will be still missed and claim fails</a>.
<br><br>

What do we miss? One more supposition fixes the claim.
c) curve has lengh - as a curve parameter.
In this case angele between a chord and H - the tangent to circumcsribed curvature circe, this angle will approach 0 when arch lengh approches 0.
Then if there exist the angle between H and T, then (according Lemma 1) there will be the third line between T and C in some neighbourhood of A which contradicts definition of T.<br><br>

Note, that this doew not exclude a possibility of swings of the curve around curvature circle.<br><br>

So, one of possible classes to which Lemma 6 and remainder of Principia is applied is a),b),c). These are Principia curves.<br><br>

"Modern Physics curves" comprise wider class, the class of curves which are differential. In this appoach, the Lemma 6 is meaningless because it is true as a  part of tangent definition.<br><br>

Note, that some author assume different class of curves in Lemma 6. For example Donahue. This autor asseme curves d) covex in some neighbourhood of A.<br><br>

Indeed, sequence of chords has an upper angle, and exact upper bound line. (This follows if to project chords to the points of "Newton Microscope line", which by corresponding geometrical axiom (d, Dedekind?) have exact upper bound.) Next, this line will be a tangent T (add absudum.)<br><br>

Therefore, the claim of Lemma 6 can be stated as 
d) convex, e) chord lenght approaches 0 when curve parameter approaches A, and d). This interpretation of Lemma 6 does not need conditions a) and b) and therefore unlikely meant by Newton.<br><br>

If the whole purpose of the lemmma 6 is to establish the class of curves which have property of "ulitmate angle between chord and tangent is zero", than it would be much simpler to say that we consider only orbits/curves with such property. In this case, lemma6 simply is not necessary.<br><br>

PS: We remember that in reference (d, Dedekind?), there was a formulation in terms of "upper bound" made by Dedekind, but somehow no longer can find it. There are some, possibly equivalent wordings (Dedekind-Cantor continuity axiom, Hilbert), but we prefer more explicit and closer to original inventor.

V.2, the Axiom of Line Completeness, replaced:
Axiom of completeness. To a system of points, straight lines, and planes, it is impossible to add other elements in such a manner that the system thus generalized shall form a new geometry obeying all of the five groups of axioms. In other words, the elements of geometry form a system which is not susceptible of extension, if we regard the five groups of axioms as valid.
The old axiom V.2 is now Theorem 32.
