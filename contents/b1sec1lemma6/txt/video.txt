Consider an ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, a ¦AB¦chord¦¦ of that ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦, 
and a ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ which touches the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ at one end of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦. 
The ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ is required to be continuous at the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦. 
If the ¦A B¦points¦¦ that determine the end of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ approach each other, 
the angle made by the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ diminishes and ultimately disappears once the ¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ meet.

If we assume the angle made by the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ does not ultimately disappear,
then the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ would contain a rectilinear angle, 
which could only happen if the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ was not continuous at the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦. 
Since we stipulated that the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ <em>is</em> continuous at the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦, 
our assumption must be wrong, 
meaning that the angle made by the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ <em>does</em> ultimately disappear.
<br><br>

The model visualizes what the assumption might look like. 
The red adjustable line forms an angle with the ¦AD¦tangent¦¦, 
and it is this angle that we could, wrongly, 
imagine is always contained within the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦, 
even after the ¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ meet. 
We observe that we can only shorten the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ so much before this angle is no longer contained. 
No matter how much we lessen this angle, 
as long as it has any value above 0, 
at some point it will not be contained within the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ 
as we bring the ¦A B¦endpoints¦¦ of the ¦AB¦chord¦¦ together.
<br><br>

This visualization is meant only as a supplement to Newton’s argument. 
The proof is based on the understanding that a continuous curvature 
will not allow the ¦arc-AB¦arc¦¦ and ¦AD¦tangent¦¦ to contain a ¦AL Ad L¦rectilinear angle¦¦.
