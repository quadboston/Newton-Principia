<b>I. Newtons logic in Lemma 11,</b>
<br>
strongly suggests that by word "curvatue", Newton means
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=circle-based-curvature#circlescribed-curvature-anchor">
"CirlescribedCurvature"
</a>
<br><br>

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma11,theorionId=proof,aspectId=english">
Drag point B to A and see that point G has limit J.
</a>

That's a diameter of curvature. It is irrelevant what limit to use
R → R<sub>c</sub> or 2R=D → D<sub>c</sub>=J.
(Rigorously, R and D are vectors from point A to point R or G on diagram, and curvature-radius-vector is a vector AJ which is a limit of these vectors).
<br><br>

(CircleSribed curvature is not the curvature χ in CalculusXX where it is |d²<b>r</b>/ds²|.
Yes, when χ exists, then CircleSribed curvature does exist too and = χ = 1/R<sub>c</sub>, but not other way around:

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curve,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=infinite-frequency-circle-based-curvature#if-circlescribed-curve">
for this curve
</a>
CircleSribed curvature does exist, but χ does not because
even the first derivative d<b>r</b>/dt does not exist.

<b>II. In addendums, there are offered 3 variants of L6:</b>
<br><br>

<b>Variant 1. Differential.</b> All of these three "Differential" versions are equivalent:
<br>

a) curve is differentiable
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#differential-version">
b) differential tangents exist
</a>
<br>

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#differential-version">
c) chord angle has a limit
</a>
<br><br><br>



<b>Variant 2.<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma6,
theorionId=proof,aspectId=model#pure-convex-version">
Lemma 6. Pure convex version.
</a></b> Apparently chosen in Dana Densmore book.
However, this does not need any premise of "continuity" and "curvature".
<br><br>



<b>Variant 3. Lemma 6. Continues CircleScribe curvature for curve with existing length.</b>
(Did not recorded yet in Addendums.)
<br><br>

Length axioms make
curve continuous at point A which becomes sufficient condition to prove the lemma.
<br><br>

This is what most likely Newton meant. However, this makes "ad absudum" proof in Book's Lemma 6 logically redundant which, perhaps, Newton did not consider significant to pay attention to.
<br><br><br>
 



<b> III. "Differential version" turns calculus logic flow upside down.</b>
<br><br>

In Equclid framework the logic is
<br><br>

... conics, prexisting curves, curve length existence and its properties are apparently assumed,
Euclidean tangents
<br>
 →
<br>
differential tangent definition and its equality to Euclidean
<br><br>

New theory logic is:
<br><br>

differential tangent definition
<br>
 →
curve length s, is built upon on differential tangent definition as
integral of ds = sqrt( dx'² + dy'² ),
<br>
→
<br>
curvature defined from d²r/ds²
<br><br>

Euclidean tangents become irrelevant,
set of curves available for new theory is expanded,
<br><br><br>


<b> IV. Apparently real point of lemma 6 </b> 
<br><br>
is actually not the proof of that E-tangent and differential tangent are equal.
Premise of existance of differential tangent constructs conceptually different definition of the tangent: differential tangent, tangent as a limiting position of decreasing chords.
<br><br>

(ii) automatically extends definition of tangent to non-Euclidean tangents, for example for
non-convex functions in neighbouhood of point A, like x²sin(1/x) at A=(0,0). 
<br><br>

Moreover, in CalculusXX, differential tangent becomes logical backbone of the Calculus instead of Euclidean tangent.
