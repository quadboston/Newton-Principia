        If in any figure |figure|AacE||, 
        comprehended by the straight lines |wall|Aa|| and |base|Ae|| and the |curve|curve acE||, 
        any number of parallelograms |inscribed-rectangles|Ab, Bc, Cd||, ... 
        are inscribed upon equal bases AB, BC, CD, ...

        and have sides Bb, Cc, Dd, ... 
        parallel to the |wall|side Aa|| of the figure; 
        and if the parallelograms aKbl, bLcm, cMdn, ... are completed; 
        if then the width of these parallelograms is diminished and their number increased indefinitely, 

        I say that the ultimate ratios which the |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed figure AKbLcMdD||, 
        the |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed figure AalbmcndoE||, 
        and the |figure|curvilinear figure AabcdE|| 
        have to one another are ratios of equality.

        Consider any |figure|figure|| bounded by a |curve|curve||, a |base|base||, and a |wall|side||. 
        Its |base|base|| can be divided into any number of equal-length bases
        for |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed rectangles|| and |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed rectangles||. 
        If we increase the number of these rectangles indefinitely, 
        then the areas of the |figure|figure||, the |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed rectangles||, and the
        |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed rectangles|| all converge to the same value.

            Nam figuræ |inscribed-rectangles|inscriptæ|| &amp; |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscriptæ|| differentia 
            est summa parallelogrammorum Kl + Lm + Mn + Do, 
            hoc est (ob æquales omnium bases)
            rectangulum sub unius basi Kb 
            &amp; altitudinum summa Aa, id est rectangulum |widthest-rectangular|ABla||. 
            
            Sed hoc rectangulum, eo quod latitudo ejus AB in infinitum minuitur, sit minus quovis dato. 
            Ergo per Lemma I, figura |inscribed-rectangles|inscripta|| &amp; |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscripta|| &amp; 
            multo magis |figure|figura curvilinea|| intermedia fiunt ultimo æquales. Q. E. D.



*::*proof|english

            For the difference of the |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed|| and |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed|| figures 
            is the sum of the parallelograms Kl, Lm, Mn, and Do, 
            that is (because they all have equal bases), 
            the rectangle having as base Kb (the base of one of them) 
            and as altitude |wall|Aa|| (the sum of the altitudes), that is, the rectangle |widthest-rectangular|ABla||.

            But this rectangle, because its width AB is diminished indefinitely, becomes less than any given rectangle. 
            Therefore (by lem. 1) the |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed figure|| and the |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed figure|| and, 
            all the more, the intermediate |figure|curvilinear figure|| become ultimately equal.  Q.E.D.


*::*proof|hypertext

            The diffference in area between the |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed rectangles|| and |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed rectangles|| 
            is equal to the area of a |widthest-rectangular|single rectangle|| on the end. 
            As the number of rectangles is increased indefinitely, the width of each
            decreases indefinitely, including the |widthest-rectangular|single rectangle|| just mentioned. 
            Since its width decreases indefinitely,
            its area decreases indefinitely, becoming arbitrarily close to 0. So the difference between the areas of the
            |inscribed-rectangles|inscribed rectangles||, the
            |circumscribed-rectangles|circumscribed rectangles||, and the |figure|figure|| in between them becomes arbitrarily close to 0. For the current figure, 
            that |widthest-rectangular|single rectangle|| is on the
