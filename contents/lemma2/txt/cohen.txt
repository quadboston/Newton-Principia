        If in any figure ¦figure Aa¦A𝑎𝑐E¦¦,
        comprehended by the straight lines ¦Aa¦A𝑎¦¦ and ¦base¦AE¦¦ and the ¦curve¦curve 𝑎𝑐E¦¦,
        any number of parallelograms ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦A𝑏, B𝑐, C𝑑¦¦, ...
        are inscribed upon equal bases ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦, ...

        and have sides ¦Bb¦B𝑏¦¦, ¦Cc¦C𝑐¦¦, ¦Dd¦D𝑑¦¦, ...
        parallel to the ¦Aa¦side A𝑎¦¦ of the figure;
        and if the parallelograms ¦difference¦aK𝑏𝑙, 𝑏L𝑐𝑚, 𝑐M𝑑𝑛¦¦, ... are completed;
        if then the ¦BC¦width¦¦ of these parallelograms is diminished and their number increased indefinitely,

        I say that the ultimate ratios which the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed figure AK𝑏L𝑐M𝑑D¦¦,
        the ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed figure A𝑎𝑙𝑏𝑚𝑐𝑛𝑑𝑜E¦¦,
        and the ¦figure-area figure-area-txt¦curvilinear figure A𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑E¦¦
        have to one another are ratios of equality.

            For the ¦difference¦¦ of the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ figures
            is the ¦difference¦sum¦¦ of the parallelograms ¦a--K--b--l¦K𝑙¦¦, ¦b--L--c--m¦L𝑚¦¦, ¦c--M--d--n¦M𝑛¦¦, and
            
            <!-- addendum uses mathematically strict variant by removing 
                 notation Do from incorrect rect.
                 see: userOptions.showingBonusFeatures() && dr.basesN > 4 -->
            ¿?
            {
                "no-higlight-do" : "Do,",
                "higlight-do" : "¦d--e--p--o¦D𝑜¦¦,"
            }¿
            
            that is (because they all have equal bases),
            the rectangle having as base ¦K𝑏¦¦ (the base of one of them)
            and as altitude ¦Aa¦A𝑎¦¦  (the sum of the altitudes), that is, the rectangle ¦widest-rectangular widt-txt¦AB𝑙𝑎¦¦.

            But this rectangle, because its width ¦AB¦¦ is diminished indefinitely, becomes less than any given rectangle.
            Therefore (by lem. 1) the ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed figure¦¦ and the ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed figure¦¦ and,
            all the more, the intermediate ¦figure-area figure-area-txt¦curvilinear figure¦¦ become ultimately equal. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.
