Under the same suppositions as in prop. 15, if ¦PR P,Zminus PZ¦straight lines¦¦
 are drawn to the ¦P¦bodies¦¦
in such a way as to touch the ¦orbit¦orbits¦¦ in the ¦P¦places where the bodies are located¦¦,
and if ¦SY¦perpendiculars¦¦ are dropped from the ¦S¦common focus¦¦ to these tangents, I say
that the ¦PR¦velocities¦¦ of the bodies are inversely as ¦SY¦the perpendiculars¦¦ and directly as
the square roots of the ¦L,LL¦principal latera recta¦¦.

[Assumied: here, latus rectum is = principal latera recta]

From ¦S¦focus S¦¦ to ¦PR P,Zminus PZ¦tangent PR¦¦ drop ¦SY¦perpendicular SY¦¦,
and ¦PR¦the velocity¦¦ of ¦P¦body P¦¦
will be inversely as the square root of ¦SY¦¦²/¦L,LL¦L¦¦.

For ¦PR¦this velocity¦¦ is as the minimally small
arc PQ described in a given particle of time,
that is (by lem. 7), as the ¦PR¦tangent PR¦¦, that
is — because the proportion of PR to QT is
as SP to SY — as SP x QT / SY or as SY inversely and SP x QT directly; and
SP x QT is as the ¦instanttriangle¦area described in the given time¦¦, that is (by prop. 14), as
the square root of the

¦L,LL¦latus rectum¦¦. Q.E.D.

And thus the ¦PR¦velocity¦¦ in a conic, at the greatest or least
distance from the focus, is to the velocity with which the body would move
in a circle, at the same distance from the center, as the square root of the
principal latus rectum is to the square root of twice that distance.

The velocities of bodies revolving in ellipses are, at their
mean distances from the common focus, the same as those of bodies revolving
in circles at the same distances, that is (by prop. 4, corol. 6), inversely as the
square roots of the distances. For the perpendiculars now coincide with the
semiaxes minor, and these are as mean proportionals between the distances
and the latera recta. Compound this ratio [of the semiaxes] inversely with
the square root of the ratio of the latera recta directly, and it will become the
square root of the ratio of the distances inversely.

In the same figure, or even in different figures whose
principal latera recta are equal, the velocity of a body is inversely as the
perpendicular dropped from the focus to the tangent.

In a parabola the velocity is inversely as the square root
of the distance of the body from the focus of the figure; in an ellipse the
velocity varies in a ratio that is greater than this, and in a hyperbola in a
ratio that is less. For (by lem. 14, corol. 2) the perpendicular dropped from
the focus to the tangent of a parabola is as the square root of that distance.
In a hyperbola the perpendicular is smaller, and in an ellipse greater, than in
this ratio.

In a parabola the velocity of a body at any distance from
the focus is to the velocity of a body revolving in a circle at the same distance
from the center as the square root of the ratio of 2 to 1; in an ellipse it is
smaller and in a hyperbola greater than in this ratio. For by corol. 2 of this
proposition the velocity in the vertex of a parabola is in this ratio, and — by
corol. 6 of this proposition and by prop. 4, corol. 6 — the same proportion is
kept at all distances. Hence, also, in a parabola the velocity everywhere is
equal to the velocity of a body revolving in a circle at half the distance; in
an ellipse it is smaller and in a hyperbola greater.

The velocity of a body revolving in any conic is to the
velocity of a body revolving in a circle at a distance of half the principal latus
rectum of the conic as that distance is to the perpendicular dropped from the
focus to the tangent of the conic. This is evident by corol. 5.

Hence, since (by prop. 4, corol. 6) the velocity of a body
revolving in this circle is to the velocity of a body revolving in any other circle
inversely in the ratio of the square roots of the distances, it follows from the
equality of the ratios [or ex aequo] that the velocity of a body revolving in a
conic will have the same ratio to the velocity of a body revolving in a circle
at the same distance that a mean proportional between that common distance
and half of the principal latus rectum of the conic has to the perpendicular
dropped from the common focus to the tangent of the conic.
