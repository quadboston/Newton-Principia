            This parallelogram will be greater than the difference of

            We can create a ¦widthest-rectangular¦new end rectangle¦¦ whose area is greater or equal to 
            the difference in area between the 
            ¦inscribed-rectangles¦inscribed¦¦ and ¦circumscribed-rectangles¦circumscribed¦¦ rectangles. 
            We guarantee it is no smaller than the difference by making its base equal 
            to the greatest width. 

            As the number of rectangles is increased indefinitely, the width of each 
            decreases indefinitely, including the ¦widthest-rectangular¦rectangle¦¦ just mentioned. 
            Since its width decreases indefinitely, its area decreases indefinitely, 
            becoming arbitrarily close to 0. So the difference between the areas of the 
            ¦inscribed-rectangles¦inscribed rectangles¦¦, the
            ¦circumscribed-rectangles¦circumscribed rectangles¦¦, and the ¦figure¦figure¦¦ in between them becomes arbitrarily close to 0. 
            For the current figure, that ¦widthest-rectangular¦single rectangle¦¦ is on the
