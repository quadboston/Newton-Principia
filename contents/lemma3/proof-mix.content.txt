            We can create a ¦widthest-rectangular widt-txt¦new end rectangle¦¦ whose area is greater or equal to 
            the difference in area between the 
            ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed¦¦ and ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed¦¦ rectangles. 
            We guarantee it is no smaller than the difference by making its base equal 
            to the greatest width. 

            As the number of rectangles is increased indefinitely, the width of each 
            decreases indefinitely, including the ¦widthest-rectangular widt-txt¦rectangle¦¦ just mentioned. 
            Since its width decreases indefinitely, its area decreases indefinitely, 
            becoming arbitrarily close to 0. So the difference between the areas of the 
            ¦inscribed-rectangles insc-txt¦inscribed rectangles¦¦, the
            ¦circumscribed-rectangles circ-txt¦circumscribed rectangles¦¦, and the ¦figure-area figure-area-txt¦figure¦¦ in between them becomes arbitrarily close to 0. 
            For the current ¦figure¦figure¦¦, that ¦widthest-rectangular widt-txt¦single rectangle¦¦ is on the
