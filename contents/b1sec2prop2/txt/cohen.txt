Every body that moves in some ¦path¦curved line¦¦ described in a plane and, by a radius
drawn to a ¦S¦point¦¦, either unmoving or moving uniformly forward with a rectilinear
motion, describes ¦SAB kepler-triangle-odd kepler-triangle-even¦areas¦¦ around that ¦S¦point¦¦ proportional to the times, is urged by a
¦forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ tending toward that same ¦S¦point¦¦.

Cᴀsᴇ 1. For every body that moves in a curved line is ¦Cc Dd Ee Ff¦deflected¦¦ from
a ¦Bc Cd De Ef¦rectilinear course¦¦ by some ¦forceMove¦force¦¦ acting upon it (by law 1). And that ¦forceMove¦force¦¦
by which the body is deflected from a ¦Bc Cd De Ef¦rectilinear course¦¦ and in equal times
is made to describe, about an immobile point ¦S¦¦, the equal minimally small
triangles ¦SAB¦¦, ¦SBC¦¦, ¦SCD¦¦, ..., acts in place ¦B¦¦ along a line parallel to ¦Cc¦𝑐C¦¦ (by
<a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI40.html">
book 1, prop. 40, of the Elements</a>,
and law 2), that is, along the ¦SB¦line BS¦¦; and
in place ¦C¦¦, the force acts along a line parallel to ¦Dd¦dD¦¦, that is, along the line
¦SC¦¦, . . . . Therefore it always acts along lines tending toward that unmoving
point ¦S¦¦. Q.E.D.
<br><br>
Cᴀsᴇ 2. And, by corol. 5 of the laws, it makes no difference whether
the surface on which the body describes a ¦path¦curvilinear figure¦¦ is at rest or
whether it moves uniformly straight forward, together with the body, the
¦path¦figure described¦¦, and the point ¦S¦¦.

Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 1.
In nonresisting spaces or mediums, if the areas are not
proportional to the times, the ¦BVaracc¦forces do not tend¦¦ toward the ¦S¦point¦¦ where the
radii meet but ¦VVaracc¦deviate¦¦ forward [or in consequentia] from it, that is, in the
direction toward which the motion takes place, provided that the ¦SBCaracc¦description
of the areas¦¦ is accelerated; but if it is retarded, they deviate backward [or in
antecedentia, i.e., in a direction contrary to that in which the motion takes
place].
<br><br>
Cᴏʀᴏʟʟᴀʀʏ 2.
In resisting mediums also, if the ¦SBCaracc¦description
of areas¦¦ is
accelerated, the ¦BVaracc¦directions of the forces¦¦ ¦VVaracc¦deviate¦¦ from the point where the radii
meet in the direction toward which the motion takes place.

A body can be urged by a ¦forceMove¦centipetal force¦¦ compounded of several forces.
In this case the meaning of the proposition is that the force which is compounded
of all the forces tends toward point ¦S¦¦. Further, if some force acts
continually along a line perpendicular to the surface described, it will cause
the body to deviate from the plane of its motion, but it will neither increase
nor decrease the quantity of the surface-area described and is therefore to be
ignored in the compounding of forces.
