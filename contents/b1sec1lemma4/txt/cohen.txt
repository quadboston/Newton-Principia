If in two figures ¦acE Aa AE¦A𝑎𝑐E¦¦ and ¦prT Pp PT¦P𝑝𝑟T¦¦ ¦inscribed-rectangles-AacE inscribed-rectangles-PprT¦two series of parallelograms¦¦ are inscribed (as
above) and the number of parallelograms in both series is the same; and if, when
their ¦base¦widths¦¦ are diminished indefinitely, the ultimate ¦parallelogramsRatio¦ratios¦¦ of the parallelograms
in one figure to the corresponding parallelograms in the other are the same; then
I say that the two figures ¦acE Aa AE¦A𝑎𝑐E¦¦ and ¦prT Pp PT¦P𝑝𝑟T¦¦ are to each other in that same ¦figuresRatio¦ratio¦¦.

For as the ¦inscribed-rectangle-AacE-1¦individual parallelograms in the one figure¦¦ are to the corresponding 
¦inscribed-rectangle-PprT-1¦individual parallelograms in the other¦¦, 
so (by composition [or componendo]) will the 
¦inscribed-rectangles-AacE¦sum of all the parallelograms in the one¦¦ 
become ¦parallelogramsRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦inscribed-rectangles-PprT¦sum of all the parallelograms in the other¦¦, 
and so also the one ¦acE Aa AE¦figure¦¦ ¦figuresRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦prT Pp PT¦other¦¦—the 
first figure, of course, being (by 
<a href="?conf=sappId=b1sec1lemma3">lem. 3</a>) 
to the first sum,
and the second figure to the second sum, in a ratio of equality. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Hence, if two quantities of any kind are divided in any
way into the same number of parts, and these parts—when their number is
increased and their size is diminished indefinitely—maintain a ¦parallelogramsRatio¦given ratio
to one another¦¦, the first to the first, the second to the second, and so on
in sequence, then the ¦figuresRatio¦wholes will be to each other¦¦ in the same given ratio.
For if the parallelograms in the figures of this lemma are taken in the same
proportion to one another as those parts, the sums of the parts will always
be as the sums of the parallelograms; and therefore, when the number of
parts and parallelograms is increased and their size diminished indefinitely,
the sums of the parts will be in the ultimate ratio of a ¦inscribed-rectangle-AacE-1¦parallelogram in one
figure¦¦ to a ¦inscribed-rectangle-PprT-1¦corresponding parallelogram in the other¦¦, that is (by hypothesis),
in the ultimate ratio of part to part.
