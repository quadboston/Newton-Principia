If in two figures ¦acE Aa AE¦AacE¦¦ and ¦prT Pp PT¦PprT¦¦ ¦inscribed-rectangles-AacE inscribed-rectangles-PprT¦two series of parallelograms¦¦ are inscribed (as
above) and the number of parallelograms in both series is the same; and if, when
their ¦base¦widths¦¦ are diminished indefinitely, the ultimate ¦parallelogramsRatio¦ratios¦¦ of the parallelograms
in one figure to the corresponding parallelograms in the other are the same; then
I say that the two figures ¦acE Aa AE¦AacE¦¦ and ¦prT Pp PT¦PprT¦¦ are to each other in that same ¦figuresRatio¦ratio¦¦.

For as the ¦inscribed-rectangle-AacE-1¦individual parallelograms in the one figure¦¦ are to the corresponding 
¦inscribed-rectangle-PprT-1¦individual parallelograms in the other¦¦, 
so (by composition [or componendo]) will the 
¦inscribed-rectangles-AacE¦sum of all the parallelograms in the one¦¦ 
become ¦parallelogramsRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦inscribed-rectangles-PprT¦sum of all the parallelograms in the other¦¦, 
and so also the one ¦acE Aa AE¦figure¦¦ ¦figuresRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦prT Pp PT¦other¦¦—the 
first figure, of course, being (by lem. 3) to the first sum,
and the second figure to the second sum, in a ratio of equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q.E.D.

Hence if two quantities of any kind whatever be divided into the same number of parts in any manner, and
those parts, as their number is increased and their size is decreased in infinitum, attain a given
ratio to each other, the first to the first, the second to the second, and the rest to the rest
in order, the wholes will be to each other in that same given ratio.

For if in the figures of this lemma the parallelograms be taken to be to
each other as the parts, the sums of the parts will always be as the sums of the
parallelograms, and consequently, where the number of the parts and of the
parallelograms be increased and the size to be decreased in infinitum, [the sums of the parts
will be] in the ulitmate ratio of parallelogram to parallelogram, that is
(by the hypothesis) in the ultimate ratio of part to part.
