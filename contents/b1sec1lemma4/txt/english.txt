If in two figures ¦acE Aa AE¦AacE¦¦, ¦prT Pp PT¦PprT¦¦,
there be inscribed ¦left-bars right-bars¦two series of parallelograms¦¦ (as before),
and if the number of the two be the same, and if, where the
¦right-bars-breadths left-bars-breadths¦breadths¦¦ are diminished in
infinitum, the ultimate ¦barsRatio¦ratios¦¦ of the individual parallelograms in one figure to the
[corresponding] individual parallelograms in the other, be the same, I say that the two
figures ¦acE Aa AE¦AacE¦¦, ¦prT Pp PT¦PprT¦¦, are to one another in that same ¦figuresRatio¦ratio¦¦.

For as ¦left-bar-1¦individual parallelogram¦¦ is to ¦right-bar-1¦individual parallelogram¦¦,
so, componendo, would the ¦leftBarsArea left-bars¦sum of them all¦¦
be ¦barsRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦rightBarsArea right-bars¦sum of them all¦¦,
and thus the ¦acE Aa AE¦figure¦¦ ¦figuresRatio¦to¦¦ the ¦prT Pp PT¦figure¦¦: because
by Lemma 3, the former figure stands to the former sum and the latter figure to the latter sum,
in the ratio of equality.

Hence if two quantities of any kind whatever be divided into the same number of parts in any manner, and
those parts, as their number is increased and their size is decreased in infinitum, attain* a given
ratio to each other, the first to the first, the second to the second, and the rest to the rest
in order, the wholes will be to each other in that same given ratio.

For if in the figures of this lemma the parallelograms be taken to be to
each other as the parts, the sums of the parts will always be as the sums of the
parallelograms, and consequently, where the number of the parts and of the
parallelograms be increased and the size to be decreased in infinitum, [the sums of the parts
will be] in the ulitmate ratio of parallelogram to parallelogram, that is
(by the hypothesis) in the ultimate ratio of part to part.
