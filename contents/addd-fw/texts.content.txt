In these Addendums, we provide logical facts which are inspired or implied by Newton's Principia and Euclid's Elements. We present mathematical "facts" as they are. Their mapping to these books is up to readers. The mapping to what Euclid or Isaac Newton thought and nuances of translation are left to historians.

It is irrelevant if impiled content is unknown to Euclid or Newton at their times.
When we suggest the mapping, we can put source Lemma in parenthesises like

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curveXX,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=areas#theorem-2">"Lemma (Theorem II)"</a>

maps to

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1s2prop2theor2,theorionId=proof,aspectId=english">"Book 1. Section II. Proposition II. Theorem II".</a>

 
<br><br>


We use two axiomatic frameworks, "Euclid" and "CalculusXX".
<br><br>

<a name="Eframework"></a>
<b>"Euclid Framework"</b> derives Geometrical and Ratio
properties from "Euclid's Elements".

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel">
Real numbers do logically exist, apparently logically follow from E.V.5, and Euclid ratios are
"embedded" into them.
</a>
<br><br>

In Newton times, however, this "embedding" and its features (developed in Dedekind's theory of cuts),
seems unknown. Newton and his contemporaries support this features by intuitively inferring them
from Geometrical models. They further hypothesize this support for magnitudes of time and force.
Development of Calculus and existence of ratio limits still relies on Geometrical intuition.
<br><br><br>




<a name="Cframework"></a>
<b>"CalculusXX"</b>. Calculus which is built in XIX-XX centuries.
<br><br>

Fundamental logical sequence: Axioms of Set theory --&gt; Number theory --&gt; Rational and Real numbers --&gt; the rest, Calculus, Analytic Geometry, ... --&gt; Physics
<br><br>

The difference from "Euclid" framwork is that "Fundamental logical sequence" is more effective, Geometry is based on Number theory, and

Legacy proportions</a>

are ignored in favour of concise Real number operations.
