⦁ Addendums contain logical extensions and logical context which is inspired by Principia. These do not pretend to be comments and interpretations. They are tried to be self contained.
<br><br>

⦁ Reader should build addendums relationship to Principia by the work of own thought when returning to Principia total content. However doing so may helps to understand what Newton really meant without relying heavily on translation of words.
<br><br>

⦁ Principia is written in Euclidian logical context, namely Geometry and Ratios (ER). Addendum may include context of Real numbers in which Calculus for modern Mechanics is built. (We name it CalculusXIX.) Apparently the lack of (Real) numbers in Newton's time was Newton's reason to support Quadratures in Principia by purely geometrical magnitudes, areas, cubes, ... as for example, in 1.8.proposition 41.
<br><br>

By the way, Books context feels as an extension of Geomtry, like adding three axioms (force laws) to the Geometry. The same way as reaxiomatizing Geometry in General Relativiy. What a coincidence.
<br><br>

Addendum may also include anything interesting like programming details or problems related to the Book.

⦁  References to original text lemma are in parenthesises. For example,

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=addd-prel-curveXX,theorionId=proof,aspectId=curve,subessayId=areas#theorem-2">"Lemma (Theorem II)"</a>

refers to

<a target="_blank" href="?conf=sappId=b1sec2prop2,theorionId=proof,aspectId=english">"Book 1. Section II. Proposition II. Theorem II".</a>
