opposite angles ¦A¦¦ and P, and if the sides AQ and AS, indefinitely produced,

Join BP and also 
CP, and from point ¦D¦¦ draw two 
straight lines DG and DE, the 
first if which (DG) is parallel to 
AB and meets PB, PQ, and CA 
at H, ¦I¦¦, and G, while the second 
(DE) is parallel to AC and meets 
PC, PS, and AB at F, K, and ¦E¦¦; 
then (by lem. 17) the rectangle 
DE × DF will be to rectangle 
DG × DH in a given ratio. But 
PQ is to DE (or IQ) as PB to 
HB and thus PT to DH; and by alternation [or alternando] PQ is to PT 
as DE to DH. Additionally, PR is to DF as RC to DC and hence as (IG 
or) PS to DG; and by alternation [or alternando] PR is to PS as DF to DG;
and when the ratios are combined, the rectangle PQ × PR comes to be to the 
rectangle PS × PT as the rectangle DE × DF to the rectangle DG × DH, 
and hence in a given ratio. But PQ and PS are given, and therefore the ratio 
of PR to PT is given. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

But if PR and PT are supposed in a given ratio to each other, 
then on working backward with a similar argument, it will follow that the 
retangle DE × DF is to the rectangle DG × DH in a given ratio and 
consequently that point ¦D¦¦ (by lem. 18) lies in a conic passing through points 
¦A¦¦, B, C and P. &nbsp;&nbsp; Q.E.D.

Hence, if BC is drawn cutting PQ in ¦r¦¦, and if Pt is taken
on PT in the ratio to Pr which PT has to PR, Bt will be a tangent of the
¦ellipse¦conic¦¦ at point B. For conceive of point ¦D¦¦ as coming together with point B
in such a way that, as chord BD vanishes, BT becomes a tangent; then CD
and BT will coincide with CB and Bt.

And vice versa, if Bt is a tangent and BD and CD meet
in any point ¦D¦¦ of the ¦ellipse¦conic¦¦, PR will be to PT as Pr to Pt. And conversely,
if PR is to PT as Pr to Pt, BD and CD will meet in some point ¦D¦¦ of the
¦ellipse¦conic¦¦.

One ¦ellipse¦conic¦¦ does not intersect another conic in more than
four points. For, if it can be done, let two conics pass through five points ¦A¦¦,
B, C, P, and O, and let the straight line BD cut these conics in points ¦D¦¦ and
d, and let the straight line Cd cut PQ in q. Then PR is to PT as Pq to PT;
hence PR and Pq are equal to each other, contrary to the hypothesis.
