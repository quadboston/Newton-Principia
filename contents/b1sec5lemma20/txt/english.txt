If in some ¦given-parallelogram¦parallelogram ASPQ¦¦, the two opposite angles ¦A¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ touch the section of
a cone at the points ¦A¦¦ and ¦P¦¦ ; and with the sides of one of the angles ¦AQ¦¦ and ¦AS¦¦
produced indefinitely, meeting the same section of the cone at ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ ; moreover from
the meeting points ¦B¦¦ and ¦C¦¦ to some fifth point ¦D¦¦ of the conic section, the two right lines
¦BD¦¦ and ¦CD¦¦ are drawn meeting the other two sides of the ¦given-parallelogram¦parallelogram¦¦ ¦PS¦¦ and ¦PQ¦¦
produced indefinitely at ¦T¦¦ &amp; ¦R¦¦: the ¦key-parts¦parts¦¦ ¦PR¦¦ and ¦PT¦¦ of the sides [ of the parallelogram]
will always be cut in turn in a given ratio. And conversely, if these cut parts are in turn in
a given ratio, the point ¦D¦¦ touches the section of the cone passing through the four points
¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦C¦¦, ¦P¦¦.

Case I. BP and CP are joined together and from the point D the two right lines DG and
DE are acting , the first of which DG shall be parallel to AB itself and meets PB and PQ
and CA in H, I and G; the other shall be DE parallel to AC itself and meeting PC and PS
and AB in F, K and E: and the rectangle DE DF × will be (by Lem. XVII.) in a given
ratio to the rectangle DG DH × . But PQ to DE (or IQ) shall be as PB to HB, and thus as
PT to DH; and in turn PQ to PT as DE to DH. And there is PR to DF as RC to DC, thus
as (IG or) PS to DG, and in turn PR to PS as VF to DG; and with the ratios joined the
rectangle PQ PR × shall be to the rectangle PS PT × as the rectangle DE DF × to the
rectangle DG DH × , and thus in a given ratio. But PQ and PS are given, and therefore
the ratio PR to PT is given. Q E.D.
<br><br>


Case 2. Because if PR and PT may be put in place in a given ratio in turn, then by
retracing the reasoning, it follows that the rectangle DE DF × to be in a given ratio to the
rectangle DG DH × , and thus the point D (by Lem. XVIII.) touches the conic section
passing through the points A, B, C and P.
Q. E. D.
<br><br>
Corol. I. Hence if BC acts cutting PQ in r, &amp; on PT there may be taken Pt in the ratio to
Pr that PT has to PR, Bt will be a tangent of the conic section at the point B. For consider
the point D to coalesce with the point B, thus so that, as with the chord BD vanishing, BT
may become a tangent; and CD and BT coincide with CB and Bt.
Corol. 2. And in turn if Bt shall be a tangent, and at some point D of the conic section BD
and CD may come together; R will be to PT as Pr to Pt. And counter wise, if there shall
be PR to PT as Pr to Pt: BD and CD may come together at some point D of the conic
section.
<br><br>


Corol. 3. A conic section does not cut a conic section in more than four points. For, it
were possible to happen, the two conic sections may pass through each other in the five
points A, B, C, P, O; and these may cut the right line BD in the points D, d, and PQ itself
may cut the right line Cd in q. Hence PR is to PT as Pq to PT; from which PR and Pq in
turn themselves may be equal, contrary to the hypothesis.
[The following lemma, related to the above, shows how to describe a branch of a
hyperbola without making use of the focus, using points on the curve only, as well as a
reference line on which related points and angles may be defined. Note the positions of
the points A, B, C, D and P in the diagrams relating to these lemmas, where the hyperbola
in the latter can be viewed as an inverted form of the ellipse in the former. Newton has
not followed with a like proof, but has introduced a new way of drawing a conic section.]
