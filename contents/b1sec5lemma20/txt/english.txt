If any ¦given-parallelogram¦parallelogram ASPQ¦¦ touches ¦ellipse¦a conic¦¦ in points ¦A¦¦ and P with two of its opposite angles ¦A¦¦ and P, and if the sides AQ and AS, indefinitely produced, ¦CA BA¦of one of these angles¦¦ meet the ¦ellipse¦said conic¦¦ in B and C, two straight lines BD and CD are drawn to any fifth point ¦D¦¦ of ¦ellipse¦the conic¦¦, meeting the other two indefinitely produced sides PS and PQ of the paralellogram in T and R; then PR and PT, the parts which are cut off the sides, will always be to each other in a given ratio. And conversely, if the ¦key-parts¦parts¦¦ which are cut off to each other in a given ratio, the point ¦D¦¦ will touch ¦ellipse¦a conic¦¦ passing through the four points ¦A¦¦, B, C, and P.

Join BP and also CP, and from point ¦D¦¦ draw two straight lines DG and DE, the first if which (DG) is parallel to AB and meets PB, PQ, and CA at H, ¦I¦¦, and G, while the second (DE) is parallel to AC and meets PC, PS, and AB at F, K, and ¦E¦¦; then (by lem. 17) the rectangle DE x DF will be to rectangle DG x DH in a given ratio. But PQ is to DE (or IQ) as PB to HB and thus PT to DH; and by alternation [or alternando] PQ is to PT as DE to DH. Additionally, PR is to DF as RC to DC and hence as (IG or) PS to DG; and when the ratios are combined, the rectangle PQ x PR comes to be to the rectangle PS x PT as the rectangle DE x DF to the rectangle DG x DH, and hence in a given ratio. But PQ and PS are given, and therefore the ratio of PR to PT is given. Q.E.D.

But if PR and PT are supposed in a given ratio to each other, then on working backward with a similar argument, it will follow that the retangle DE x DF is to the rectangle DG x DH in a given ratio and consequently that point ¦D¦¦ (by lem. 18) lies in a conic passing through points ¦A¦¦, B, C and P. Q.E.D.

Hence, if BC is drawn cutting PQ in ¦r¦¦, and if Pt is taken
on PT in the ratio to Pr which PT has to PR, Bt will be a tangent of the
¦ellipse¦conic¦¦ at point B. For conceive of point ¦D¦¦ as coming together with point B
in such a way that, as chord BD vanishes, BT becomes a tangent; then CD
and BT will coincide with CB and Bt.

And vice versa, if Bt is a tangent and BD and CD meet
in any point ¦D¦¦ of the ¦ellipse¦conic¦¦, PR will be to PT as Pr to Pt. And conversely,
if PR is to PT as Pr to Pt, BD and CD will meet in some point ¦D¦¦ of the
¦ellipse¦conic¦¦.

One ¦ellipse¦conic¦¦ does not intersect another conic in more than
four points. For, if it can be done, let two conies pass through five points ¦A¦¦,
B, C, P, and O, and let the straight line BD cut these conies in points ¦D¦¦ and
d, and let the straight line Cd cut PQ in q. Then PR is to PT as Pq to PT;
hence PR and Pq are equal to each other, contrary to the hypothesis.
