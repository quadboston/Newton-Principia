For ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ and points P,A,B,C on it's circumference, the ratio
¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ will be constant when the point ¦generators¦D¦¦ moves along this circumference.

<br><br>

Where ¦tangent¦Bt¦¦ is a tangent erected to the ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ and points ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦ and ¦key-triangle¦T¦¦ obtained by
lines ¦generators¦BD¦¦ and ¦generators¦BC¦¦ corresponding crossing with lines ¦given-paralellogram¦PS¦¦ and ¦given-paralellogram¦PQ¦¦
which are chosen parallel to
¦base-figure¦AB¦¦ and ¦base-figure¦AC¦¦ correspondingly.
<br><br>

This claim can be used both ways: eigther move point T and keep point ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦ in proper propotion with T
which makes point ¦generators¦D drawing¦¦ the ellipse, or, in other way, ¦generators¦draw point D¦¦ along the given ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ which
will move points T and ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦.

<b>Numerical Model</b><br><br>

Proof sketch.
<br><br>


¦key-triangle¦Triangle RPT¦¦ is <br>
1) similar to ¦static-generator¦given triangle rPt¦¦;
<br>
therefore, the ratio ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ is constant when point ¦generators¦D¦¦ moves along the ellipse.<br><br>


Proof for proposition 1):
If ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ is a circle, then comparision of angles implies that <br><br>
1.2) triangles CRP and BTP are similar;<br><br>
therefore ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ = ratio of sides of given base triangle CPB, so it is a constant, and
therefore ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ = ¦static-generator¦Pr/Pt¦¦ which implies the similartity in the proposition 1)
<br><br>

If one rescales parameters of ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ from their values ¦ellipse¦a=b=1¦¦ for circle, then<br>
1.3) this preserves relation of parallelity and ¦tangent¦tangentiality¦¦ so 1) still holds. 
<br><br>

1.3) follows from equation of line r = n*t + r0: two lines r and r' are parallel iff n and n' are propotional: n=c n';
changing coordinates from x to xa and from y to ya changes n to [nx/a, nx/b] and still leaves n and n' proportional
and lines transform to lines;
<br>
¦tangent¦Tangentiality¦¦ is preserved because for line having two intersection points with ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ does not change when scales change.
<br><br>

One who would like to follow Newton's proof probably can start from Appolonius Book III.
<br><br>

The future addition to this illustration can be creating two sliders to change ellipse parameters
¦ellipse¦a, b¦¦.<br><br>
