LEMMA XX.
Si parallelogrammum quodvis ASPQ angulis duobus oppositis A &amp; P tangit sectionem
quamvis conicam in punctis A &amp; P; &amp; lateribus unius angulorum illorum infinite

&amp; C ad quintum quodvis si sectionis conicae punctum D agantur rectae duae BD, CD
occurrentes alteris duobus infinite productis
parallelogrammi lateribus PS, PQ in T &amp; R: erunt
simper abscissae laterum partes PR &amp; PT ad invicem
in data ratione. Et contra, si partes illae abscissae
sunt ad invicem in data ratione, punctum D tanget
sectionem conicam per puncta quatuor A, B, C, P
transeuntem.
Cas. I. Iungantur BP, CP &amp; a puncto D agantur
rectae duae DG, DE, quarum prior DG ipsi AB
parallela sit &amp; occurrat PB, PQ, CA in H, I, G; altera
est DE parallela sit ipsi AC &amp; occurrat PC, PS, AB in F, K, E: &amp; erit (per Lem. XVII.)
rectangulum DE DF × ad rectangulum DG DH × in ratione data. Sed est PQ ad DE (seu
IQ) ut PB ad HB, ideoque ut PT ad DH; &amp; vicissim PQ ad PT ut DE ad DH. Est &amp; PR ad
DF ut RC ad DC, ideo ut (IG vel) PS ad DG, &amp; vicissim PR ad PS ut VF ad DG; &amp;
conjunctis rationibus sit rectangulum PQ PR × ad rectangulum PS PT × ut rectangulum

Cas. 2. Quod si PR &amp; P T ponantur in data ratione ad invicem tum simili ratiocinio
regrediendo, sequetur esse rectangulum DE DF × ad rectangulum DG DH × in ratione
data, ideoque punctum D (per Lem. XVIII.) contingere conicam sectionem transeuntem
per puncta A, B, C, P.
Q. E. D.
Corol. I. Hinc si agatur BC secans PQ in r, &amp; in PT capiatur Pt in ratione ad Pr quam
habet PT ad PR: erit Bt tangens conicae sectionis ad punctum B. Nam concipe punctum D
coire cum puncto B, ita ut, chorda BD evanescente, B T tangens evadat; &amp; CD ac BT
coincident cum CB &amp; Bt.
Corol. 2. Et vice versa si Bt sit tangens, &amp; ad quodvis conicae sectionis punctum D
conveniant BD., CD; erit R ad PT ut Pr ad Pt. Et contra, si sit PR ad PT ut Pr ad Pt:
convenient, BD, CD ad conicae sectionis punctum aliquod D.
Corol. 3. Conica sectio non secat conicam sectionem in punctis pluribus quam quatuor.
Nam, si fieri potest, transeant duae conicae sectiones per quinque puncta A, B, C, P,O;
easque secet recta BD in punctis D, d, &amp; ipsam PQ secet recta Cd in q. Ergo PR est ad
PT ut Pq ad PT; unde PR &amp; Pq sibi invicem aequantur, contra hypothesin.

 If in some parallelogram ASPQ, the two opposite angles A and P touch the section of
a cone at the points A and P ; and with the sides of one of the angles AQ and AS
produced indefinitely, meeting the same section of the cone at B and C ; moreover from
the meeting points B and C to some fifth point D of the conic section, the two right lines
BD and CD are drawn meeting the other two sides of the parallelogram ¦given-paralellogram¦PS¦¦ and ¦given-paralellogram¦PQ¦¦
produced indefinitely at T &amp; R: the parts ¦key-triangle¦PR¦¦ and ¦key-triangle¦PT¦¦ of the sides [ of the parallelogram]
will always be cut in turn in a given ratio. And conversely, if these cut parts are in turn in
a given ratio, the point D touches the section of the cone passing through the four points
A, B, C, P.

¦key-triangle¦PR¦¦¦
Case I. BP and CP are joined together and from the point D the two right lines DG and
DE are acting , the first of which DG shall be parallel to AB itself and meets PB and PQ
and CA in H, I and G; the other shall be DE parallel to AC itself and meeting PC and PS
and AB in F, K and E: and the rectangle DE DF × will be (by Lem. XVII.) in a given
ratio to the rectangle DG DH × . But PQ to DE (or IQ) shall be as PB to HB, and thus as
PT to DH; and in turn PQ to PT as DE to DH. And there is PR to DF as RC to DC, thus
as (IG or) PS to DG, and in turn PR to PS as VF to DG; and with the ratios joined the
rectangle PQ PR × shall be to the rectangle PS PT × as the rectangle DE DF × to the
rectangle DG DH × , and thus in a given ratio. But PQ and PS are given, and therefore
the ratio PR to PT is given. Q E.D.
<br><br>


Case 2. Because if PR and PT may be put in place in a given ratio in turn, then by
retracing the reasoning, it follows that the rectangle DE DF × to be in a given ratio to the
rectangle DG DH × , and thus the point D (by Lem. XVIII.) touches the conic section
passing through the points A, B, C and P.
Q. E. D.
<br><br>
Corol. I. Hence if BC acts cutting PQ in r, &amp; on PT there may be taken Pt in the ratio to
Pr that PT has to PR, Bt will be a tangent of the conic section at the point B. For consider
the point D to coalesce with the point B, thus so that, as with the chord BD vanishing, BT
may become a tangent; and CD and BT coincide with CB and Bt.
Corol. 2. And in turn if Bt shall be a tangent, and at some point D of the conic section BD
and CD may come together; R will be to PT as Pr to Pt. And counter wise, if there shall
be PR to PT as Pr to Pt: BD and CD may come together at some point D of the conic
section.
<br><br>


Corol. 3. A conic section does not cut a conic section in more than four points. For, it
were possible to happen, the two conic sections may pass through each other in the five
points A, B, C, P, O; and these may cut the right line BD in the points D, d, and PQ itself
may cut the right line Cd in q. Hence PR is to PT as Pq to PT; from which PR and Pq in
turn themselves may be equal, contrary to the hypothesis.
[The following lemma, related to the above, shows how to describe a branch of a
hyperbola without making use of the focus, using points on the curve only, as well as a
reference line on which related points and angles may be defined. Note the positions of
the points A, B, C, D and P in the diagrams relating to these lemmas, where the hyperbola
in the latter can be viewed as an inverted form of the ellipse in the former. Newton has
not followed with a like proof, but has introduced a new way of drawing a conic section.]

For ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ and points P,A,B,C on it's circumference, the ratio
¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ will be constant when the point ¦generators¦D¦¦ moves along this circumference.

<br><br>

Where ¦tangent¦Bt¦¦ is a tangent erected to the ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ and points ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦ and ¦key-triangle¦T¦¦ obtained by
lines ¦generators¦BD¦¦ and ¦generators¦BC¦¦ corresponding crossing with lines ¦given-paralellogram¦PS¦¦ and ¦given-paralellogram¦PQ¦¦
which are chosen parallel to
¦base-figure¦AB¦¦ and ¦base-figure¦AC¦¦ correspondingly.
<br><br>

This claim can be used both ways: eigther move point T and keep point ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦ in proper propotion with T
which makes point ¦generators¦D drawing¦¦ the ellipse, or, in other way, ¦generators¦draw point D¦¦ along the given ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ which
will move points T and ¦key-triangle¦R¦¦.

<b>Numerical Model</b><br><br>

¦ellipse¦a¦¦¦ ¦ellipse¦b¦¦¦
Proof for ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ \( x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1 \).
<br><br>


¦key-triangle¦Triangle RPT¦¦ is <br>
1) similar to ¦static-generator¦given triangle rPt¦¦;
<br>
therefore, the ratio ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ is constant when point ¦generators¦D¦¦ moves along the ellipse.<br><br>


Proof for (1):
If ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ is a circle, then comparision of angles implies that <br><br>
1.2) triangles ¦similar-triangle¦CPB¦¦ and ¦key-triangle¦RPT¦¦ are similar;<br><br>
therefore ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ = ratio of sides PC/PB of given triangle, so this ratio is a constant, and
therefore ¦key-triangle¦PR/PT¦¦ = ¦static-generator¦Pr/Pt¦¦ which implies the similartity in the proposition (1)
<br><br>

If given ellipse is not a circle, then if one rescales parameters of ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ from their circular values ¦ellipse¦a=b=1¦¦ to given values, then
<br><br>
1.3) this preserves relation of parallelity and ¦tangent¦tangentiality¦¦,
<br><br>
so (1) still holds. 
<br><br>
(1.3) follows from equation of line r = n*t + r0: two lines r and r' are parallel iff n and n' are propotional: n=c n';
changing coordinates from x to xa and from y to ya changes n to [nx/a, nx/b] and still leaves n and n' proportional
and lines transform to lines;
<br>
¦tangent¦Tangentiality¦¦ is preserved because for line having two intersection points with ¦ellipse¦ellipse¦¦ does not change when scales change.
