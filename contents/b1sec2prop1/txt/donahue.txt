The ¦kepler-triangle¦areas¦¦, which bodies driven in ¦path¦orbits¦¦ [gyros] describe by radii drawn to an immobile ¦S¦center¦¦ of forces, are contained in immobile planes and are proportional to the times.

<span class="captured-reference id-1-0">Let the time be divided into equal parts</span>
, and 
in the first part of the time let the body,
by its inherent force, describe the straight line ¦AB¦AB¦¦.
<br><br>


<span class="captured-reference id-1-1">In the second part of the time</span>,
the same body, if nothing there to impede it, would pass on by means of a straight line
to ¦c¦c¦¦ (by Law 1), describing the line ¦Bc¦Bc¦¦ equal to ¦AB¦AB¦¦, with the result that,
radii ¦SA¦AS¦¦, ¦SB¦BS¦¦, ¦Sc¦cS¦¦ being drawn to the center, the areas ¦SAB¦ASB¦¦,

¦SBc¦BSc¦¦ would come out equal.
<br><br>


<span class="captured-reference id-1-2">But when the body comes to ¦B¦B¦¦</span>,
let the centripetal force ¦force forceMove¦act¦¦ with an impulse
that is single but great, and let it have the effect of making the body depart from the
straight line ¦Bc¦Bc¦¦ and continue in the straight line ¦BC¦BC¦¦.
<br><br>

Let ¦Cc¦cC¦¦ be drawn parallel to ¦SB¦BS¦¦,
meeting ¦BC¦BC¦¦ at ¦C¦C¦¦; and,
the second part of the time being completed, the body (by Corollary 1 of the Laws) will
be located at ¦C¦C¦¦, in the same plane as the triangle ¦SA SB AB¦ASB¦¦.
<br><br><br>

<span class="captured-reference id-1-3">Connect ¦SC¦SC¦¦</span>, and, because of the parallels ¦SB¦SB¦¦, ¦Cc¦Cc¦¦,
triangle ¦SBC¦¦ will be equal to
triangle ¦SBc¦¦, and
therefore also to triangle ¦SAB¦¦.
<br><br>


<span class="captured-reference id-motion-F">By a similar argument,</span>

if the centripetal ¦force¦¦ ¦forceMove force¦should act¦¦ successively at

<span class="captured-reference id-1-C">¦C¦C¦¦</span>,

<span class="captured-reference id-1-D">¦D¦D¦¦</span>,

<span class="captured-reference id-1-E">¦E¦E¦¦</span>,

and so on,

making the body describe,
the individual straight lines ¦CD¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦EF¦¦, and so on,
in the individual particles of the time,

all these will lie in the same plane, and the triangle ¦SCD¦¦ will be equal
to triangle
¦SBC¦¦, and ¦SDE¦¦ to ¦SCD¦¦, and
¦SEF¦¦ to ¦SDE¦¦.
<br><br>

Therefore, in equal times equal areas are described in a motionless plane; and
componendo, any sums whatever of areas ¦SABCD¦SADS¦¦,
¦SABCDEF¦SAFS¦¦
are to one another as the times of description.
<br><br>


<span class="captured-reference id-more-triangles">Now let the number</span>

of the triangles be increased and their breadth decreased
in infinitum, and their ultimate perimeter ¦AB BC CD DE EF¦ADF¦¦
(by Corollary Four of Lemma Three)
will be a curved line:

and therefore the centripetal ¦force¦¦, by with the body is perpetually ¦forceMove Cc Dd Ee Ff¦drawn back from the¦¦
tangent of this curve, will act without ceasing,

while any described areas whatever ¦SABCD¦SADS¦¦,
¦SABCDEF¦SAFS¦¦,
always proportional to the times of
description, will be proportional to those times in this case.

*..*

The velocity of a body attracted to an ¦S¦immobile centre¦¦ in
nonresisting spaces is inversely as the ¦SP¦perpendicular¦¦ dropped from that center to
the ¦TP¦rectilinear tangent¦¦ of the orbit. For in those places ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦C¦¦,
¦D¦¦, ¦E¦¦, the
¦speed¦velocity¦¦ is as the bases of the equal triangles ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦, and
these bases are inversely as the perpendiculars dropped to them.

If the chords, ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦ of two arcs described successively in equal
times by the same body
in nonresisting spaces be completed into a parallelogram ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦,
and its ¦force-0-applied¦diagonal¦¦, in that
position which it ultimately has when those arcs are diminished in infinitum,
be produced in both directions, it will ¦SB¦pass through¦¦ the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦.
<br><br><br>

*::*corollary|english

  "subessayCaption" : "Corollary 3",

If the chords ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦, and ¦DE¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦EF¦¦,
of arcs described in equal times, in
nonresisting spaces be completed into parallelograms ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦, ¦DEFZ¦DEFZ¦¦, the
forces at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦ are to each other in the ultimate ratio of the
diagonals ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦, ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦,
where these arcs are diminished in infinitum.
<br><br>

For the motions ¦BC¦BC¦¦ and ¦EF¦EF¦¦ of the body are (by Corollary 1 of the Laws)
composed of the motions
¦Bh¦Bc¦¦, ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦, and ¦Eg¦Ef¦¦, ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦, equal to ¦Ch¦Cc¦¦ and ¦Fg¦Ff¦¦, were in the
demonstration of this proposition generated
by the impulses of the centripetal force at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦, and therefore are proportional to
these impulses.

*..*

The forces by which any bodies in nonresisting spaces ¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦are drawn back¦¦ from rectilinear motions and are deflected into curved orbits are to one another as those
¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ of arcs described
in equal times which converge to the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦ and bisect ¦AC DF¦the chords¦¦, when
those arcs are diminished in infinitum. For these ¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ are
the halves of the ¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦diagonals¦¦ with which we have been concerned in Corollary 3.

T.1. Corollary 5.
Therefore, the same forces are to the force of gravity [gravitas] as these sagittae are to
the sagittae, perpendicular to the horizon, of parabolic arcs which projectiles describe in the
same time.

T.1. Corollary 6.
All the same things pertain, by Corollary 5 of the Laws, where the planes in which the
bodies move, along with the centres of forces located in them, are not at rest, but move
uniformely in a straight line.
