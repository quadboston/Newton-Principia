The ¦kepler-triangle¦areas¦¦ which bodies made to move in ¦path¦orbits¦¦ describe by radii drawn to an unmoving
¦S¦center¦¦ of forces lie in unmoving planes and are proportional to the times.

*..*

Let the time be divided into equal parts, and in 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-0">the first part of the time</span> let a body by its inherent force describe the straight line ¦AB¦¦.
<br><br>

In <span class="captured-reference id-1-1">the second part of the time</span>, if nothing hindered it, this body would (by law 1)
go straight on to ¦c¦¦, describing line ¦Bc¦¦ equal to ¦AB¦¦, so that－when radii ¦SA¦AS¦¦,
¦SB¦BS¦¦, and ¦Sc¦cS¦¦ were drawn to the center－the equal areas ¦SAB¦ASB¦¦ and ¦SBc¦BSc¦¦ would
be described.
<br><br>

But <span class="captured-reference id-1-2">when the body comes to ¦B¦¦</span>,
let a ¦force forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ act with
a single but great impulse and make the body deviate from the straight line
¦Bc¦¦ and proceed in the straight line ¦BC¦¦.
<br><br>

Let ¦Cc¦cC¦¦ be drawn parallel to ¦SB¦BS¦¦ and
meet ¦BC¦BC¦¦ at ¦C¦¦; then, when the second part of the time has been completed,
the body (by corol. 1 of the laws) will be found at ¦C¦¦ in the same plane as
triangle ¦SA SB AB¦ASB¦¦.
<br><br>

<span class="captured-reference id-1-3">Join ¦SC¦¦</span>; and because ¦SB¦¦ and ¦Cc¦¦ are parallel, triangle ¦SBC¦¦
will be equal to triangle ¦SBc¦¦ and thus also to triangle ¦SAB¦¦.
<br><br>

By a similar
argument, if the ¦forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ acts successively at 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-C">¦C¦C¦¦</span>,
<span class="captured-reference id-1-D">¦D¦D¦¦</span>, 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-E">¦E¦E¦¦</span>, 
..., making
the body in each of the individual particles of time describe the individual
straight lines ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦, ..., all these lines will lie in the same plane;
and triangle ¦SCD¦¦ will be equal to triangle ¦SBC¦¦, ¦SDE¦¦ to ¦SCD¦¦, and ¦SEF¦¦ to
¦SDE¦¦. 
<br><br>

Therefore, in equal times equal areas are described in an unmoving
plane; and by composition, any sums ¦SAB SBC SCD¦SADS¦¦ and ¦SAB SBC SCD SDE SEF¦SAFS¦¦ of
the areas are to each other as the times of description.
<br><br>

Now <span class="captured-reference id-more-triangles">let the number
of triangles be increased and their width decreased</span> indefinitely, and their
ultimate perimeter ¦AB BC CD DE EF path¦ADF¦¦ will (by lem. 3, corol. 4) be a curved line; and
thus the ¦forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ by which the body is continually drawn back from
the tangent of this curve will act uninterruptedly, while any areas described,
¦SAB SBC SCD¦SADS¦¦ and ¦SAB SBC SCD SDE SEF¦SAFS¦¦, which are always proportional to the times of description,
will be proportional to those times in this case.

The velocity of a body attracted to an ¦S¦immobile centre¦¦ in
nonresisting spaces is inversely as the ¦SP¦perpendicular¦¦ dropped from that center to
the ¦TP¦rectilinear tangent¦¦ of the orbit. For in those places ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦C¦¦,
¦D¦¦, ¦E¦¦, the
¦speed¦velocity¦¦ is as the bases of the equal triangles ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦, and
these bases are inversely as the perpendiculars dropped to them.

If the chords, ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦ of two arcs described successively in equal
times by the same body
in nonresisting spaces be completed into a parallelogram ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦,
and its ¦force-0-applied¦diagonal¦¦, in that
position which it ultimately has when those arcs are diminished in infinitum,
be produced in both directions, it will ¦SB¦pass through¦¦ the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦.

*::*corollary|english

  "subessayCaption" : "Corollary 3",

}

If the chords ¦AB¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦BC¦¦, and ¦DE¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦EF¦¦,
of arcs described in equal times, in
nonresisting spaces be completed into parallelograms ¦ABCV¦ABCV¦¦, ¦DEFZ¦DEFZ¦¦, the
forces at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦ are to each other in the ultimate ratio of the
diagonals ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦, ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦,
where these arcs are diminished in infinitum.
<br><br>

For the motions ¦BC¦BC¦¦ and ¦EF¦EF¦¦ of the body are (by Corollary 1 of the Laws)
composed of the motions
¦Bh¦Bc¦¦, ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦, and ¦Eg¦Ef¦¦, ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦, equal to ¦Ch¦Cc¦¦ and ¦Fg¦Ff¦¦, were in the
demonstration of this proposition generated
by the impulses of the centripetal force at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦, and therefore are proportional to
these impulses.

}
*..*

The forces by which any bodies in nonresisting spaces ¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦are drawn back¦¦ from rectilinear motions and are deflected into curved orbits are to one another as those
¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ of arcs described
in equal times which converge to the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦ and bisect ¦AC DF¦the chords¦¦, when
those arcs are diminished in infinitum. For these ¦BU EW¦sagittae¦¦ are
the halves of the ¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦diagonals¦¦ with which we have been concerned in Corollary 3.

T.1. Corollary 5.
Therefore, the same forces are to the force of gravity [gravitas] as these sagittae are to
the sagittae, perpendicular to the horizon, of parabolic arcs which projectiles describe in the
same time.

All the same things pertain, by Corollary 5 of the Laws, where the planes in which the
bodies move, along with the centres of forces located in them, are not at rest, but move
