The ¦kepler-triangle¦areas¦¦ which bodies made to move in ¦path¦orbits¦¦ describe by radii drawn to an unmoving
¦S¦center¦¦ of forces lie in unmoving planes and are proportional to the times.

*..*

Let the time be divided into equal parts, and in 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-0">the first part of the time</span> let a body by its inherent force describe the straight line ¦AB¦¦.
<br><br>

In <span class="captured-reference id-1-1">the second part of the time</span>, if nothing hindered it, this body would (by law 1)
go straight on to ¦c¦¦, describing line ¦Bc¦¦ equal to ¦AB¦¦, so that－when radii ¦SA¦AS¦¦,
¦SB¦BS¦¦, and ¦Sc¦cS¦¦ were drawn to the center－the equal areas ¦SAB¦ASB¦¦ and ¦SBc¦BSc¦¦ would
be described.
<br><br>

But <span class="captured-reference id-1-2">when the body comes to ¦B¦¦</span>,
let a ¦force forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ act with
a single but great impulse and make the body deviate from the straight line
¦Bc¦¦ and proceed in the straight line ¦BC¦¦.
<br><br>

Let ¦Cc¦cC¦¦ be drawn parallel to ¦SB¦BS¦¦ and
meet ¦BC¦BC¦¦ at ¦C¦¦; then, when the second part of the time has been completed,
the body (by corol. 1 of the laws) will be found at ¦C¦¦ in the same plane as
triangle ¦SA SB AB¦ASB¦¦.
<br><br>

<span class="captured-reference id-1-3">Join ¦SC¦¦</span>; and because ¦SB¦¦ and ¦Cc¦¦ are parallel, triangle ¦SBC¦¦
will be equal to triangle ¦SBc¦¦ and thus also to triangle ¦SAB¦¦.
<br><br>

By a similar
argument, if the ¦forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ acts successively at 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-C">¦C¦C¦¦</span>,
<span class="captured-reference id-1-D">¦D¦D¦¦</span>, 
<span class="captured-reference id-1-E">¦E¦E¦¦</span>, 
..., making
the body in each of the individual particles of time describe the individual
straight lines ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦, ..., all these lines will lie in the same plane;
and triangle ¦SCD¦¦ will be equal to triangle ¦SBC¦¦, ¦SDE¦¦ to ¦SCD¦¦, and ¦SEF¦¦ to
¦SDE¦¦. 
<br><br>

Therefore, in equal times equal areas are described in an unmoving
plane; and by composition, any sums ¦SAB SBC SCD¦SADS¦¦ and ¦SAB SBC SCD SDE SEF¦SAFS¦¦ of
the areas are to each other as the times of description.
<br><br>

Now <span class="captured-reference id-more-triangles">let the number
of triangles be increased and their width decreased</span> indefinitely, and their
ultimate perimeter ¦AB BC CD DE EF path¦ADF¦¦ will (by lem. 3, corol. 4) be a curved line; and
thus the ¦forceMove¦centripetal force¦¦ by which the body is continually drawn back from
the tangent of this curve will act uninterruptedly, while any areas described,
¦SAB SBC SCD¦SADS¦¦ and ¦SAB SBC SCD SDE SEF¦SAFS¦¦, which are always proportional to the times of description,
will be proportional to those times in this case.

In nonresisting spaces, the velocity of a body attracted
to an immobile ¦S¦center¦¦ is inversely as the ¦SP¦perpendicular¦¦ dropped from that
center to the straight line which is ¦TP¦tangent¦¦ to the orbit. For the velocities
in those places ¦A¦¦, ¦B¦¦, ¦C¦¦, ¦D¦¦, and ¦E¦¦ are respectively as the bases of the equal
triangles ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦, ¦CD¦¦, ¦DE¦¦, and ¦EF¦¦, and these bases are inversely as the
¦SP¦perpendiculars¦¦ dropped to them.

*..*

If chords ¦AB¦¦ and ¦BC¦¦ of two arcs successively described
by the same body in equal times in nonresisting spaces are completed into the
parallelogram ¦ABCV¦¦, and diagonal ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦ (in the position that it ultimately has
when those arcs are decreased indefinitely) is produced in both directions, it
will ¦SB¦pass through¦¦ the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦.

}
*..*

If chords ¦AB¦¦, ¦BC¦¦ and ¦DE¦¦, ¦EF¦¦ of arcs described in equal
times in nonresisting spaces are completed into parallelograms ¦ABCV¦¦ and
¦DEFZ¦¦, then the forces at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦ are to each other in the ultimate ratio
of the diagonals ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦ and ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦ when the arcs are decreased indefinitely. For
the motions ¦BC¦¦ and ¦EF¦¦ of the body are (by corol. 1 of the laws) compounded
of the motions ¦Bc¦¦, ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦ and ¦Ef¦¦, ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦; but in the proof of this
proposition ¦force-0-applied¦BV¦¦ and ¦force-3-applied¦EZ¦¦, equal to ¦Cc¦¦ and ¦Ff¦¦, were generated by the impulses
of the centripetal force at ¦B¦¦ and ¦E¦¦, and thus are proportional to these
impulses.

The forces by which any bodies in nonresisting spaces
¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦are drawn back¦¦ from rectilinear motions and are deflected into curved orbits
are to one another as those ¦BU EW¦sagittas¦¦ of arcs described in equal times which
converge to the ¦S¦center of forces¦¦ and bisect the ¦AC DF¦chords¦¦ when the arcs are
decreased indefinitely. For these ¦BU EW¦sagittas¦¦ are halves of the ¦force-0-applied force-3-applied¦diagonals¦¦ with
which we dealt in corol. 3.

And therefore these forces are to the force of gravity as
these sagittas are to the sagittas, perpendicular to the horizon, of the parabolic
arcs that projectiles describe in the same time.

All the same things hold, by corol. 5 of the laws, when
the planes in which the bodies are moving, together with the centers of forces
that are situated in those planes, are not at rest but move uniformly straight
forward.
