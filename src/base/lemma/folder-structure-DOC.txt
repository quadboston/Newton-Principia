The intended purpose for media-model and study-model:

media-model:
	Common code for painting the shapes, points, lines, and curves using SVG.

study-model:
	Model-calculational code specific to certain motion. 
	For example, to Kepler-motion (motion with constant sectorial speed.)
	Such code that is specific to a single model is intended to be found
	in that model's 'model-upcreate.js' file
	(contents/[model]/js/model-upcreate.js).
