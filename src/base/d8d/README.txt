D8D can be used in 4 ways.

The first one is to use "device" D8D api.

The second one is to use lemmaD8D api. It can be used in two ways. The "low level" is to populate dragWraps via lemmaD8D pointWrap to dragWrap method.

The other one is to use rgx to draglist and optionally modify rgX drag events methods.

The last one, is to simply declare draggableX or Y in sconf.js This will create basic slider methods and optionally modify drag events afterwards.
