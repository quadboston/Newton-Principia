For while the points |point_B|B||, |point_C|C|| approach towards the point |point_A|A||,
suppose always |AD|AD|| to be produced to the remote points |point_d|d|| and |point_e|e||,
so as |Ad|Ad||, |Ae|Ae|| may be proportional to |AD|AD||, |AE|AE||;

and the ordinates |db|db||, |ec|ec||, to be drawn
parallel to the ordinates |DB|DB|| and |EC|EC||,
and meeting |AB|AB|| and |AC|AC|| produced in |point_b|b|| and |point_c|c||.

Let the curve |Abc|Abc|| be similar to the curve |ABC|ABC||, and
draw the right line |Ag|Ag|| so as to touch both curves in |point_A|A||, and
cut the ordinates |DB|DB||, |EC|EC||, |db|db||, |ec|ec||, in F, G, |point_f|f||, |point_g|g||.

Then supposing the length |Ae|Ae|| to remain the same,
let the points |point_B|B|| and |point_C|C|| meet the point |point_A|A||; and the angle cAg vanishing,

the curvilinear areas |Abd|Abd||, |Ace|Ace|| will coincide with the
rectilinear areas |Afd|Afd||, |Age|Age||;
and therefore (by Lem 5) will be one to other in the duplicate ratio of the sides |Ad|Ad||, |Ae|Ae||.

But the areas |ABD|ABD||, |ACE|ACE|| are always proportional to these areas;
and so the sides |AD|AD||, |AE|AE|| are to these sides.

And therefore the areas |ABD|ABD||, |ACE|ACE|| are ultimately one to the other
in the duplicate ratio of the sides |AD|AD||, |AE|AE||.
